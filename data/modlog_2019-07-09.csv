*Globalisation and its discontents* is also good. It's main message, that the 90ies one-size-fits-all structural adjustments were not such a great idea is nowadays even accepted by the IMF. The 2016 version also contains a new part about Trump. However, I found that addendum extremely disappointing and no match in quality to the rest.

On top of that, you might be interested in this [IMF-paper](https://www.elibrary.imf.org/view/IMF001/25883-9781498305402/25883-9781498305402/25883-9781498305402.xml?redirect=true).

>Industrial policy is tainted with bad reputation among policymakers and academics and is often viewed as the road to perdition for developing economies. Yet the success of the Asian Miracles with industrial policy stands as an uncomfortable story that many ignore or claim it cannot be replicated. Using a theory and empirical evidence, we argue that one can learn more from miracles than failures. We suggest three key principles behind their success: (i) the support of domestic producers in sophisticated industries, beyond the initial comparative advantage; (ii) export orientation; and (iii) the pursuit of fierce competition with strict accountability.

Another interesting thing to read up on is [artificial demand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_demand). (I just started reading *Buy-ology* by Martin Lindstrom.)

The buyers’ incentive is to pay as little as possible. Given that they know he wants to liquidate, they’d no doubt bargain the price down. How far depends on a number of factors, including the buyers’ belief in the long-term value of Amazon, and how urgently Bezos needs to sell.

There's obviously the question of, ""from which of the canonical four components of GDP (consumer spending, investment, government spending, and net exports) did this rise originate?"" But that's probably not what you're after by asking this question, since that's almost a tautology. Questions they ask in basic econ like ""if investment increases, what does GDP do?"" are basically like asking, ""if aggregate demand increases, what happens to aggregate demand?"". (GDP and aggregate demand are essentially the same thing.) It's incredibly elementary and has no deeper explanatory power.

More interesting to examine would be what *permitted or triggered* the rise in spending to begin with. Was it that people started digging into their savings a bit more? Was it that more resources were found which permitted increased production of goods and services? Was it that the government increased the money supply in the economy and created temporary stimulation which lasted long enough (before the euphoria died off and inflation set in) to render an increase in real spending in the latest GDP figure?

However, it may be more helpful to think of elasticity as the relative or change in y per relative change in x rather than the 'unitless slope at a point', although this is technically correct.

Rural parts of the US also tend to receive relatively more military spending (big bases), highway spending, and farm subsidies.  The political implications are interesting.

Edit: BTW the table is a little misleading since states are listed in the order of total net spending, so the top and bottom are skewed towards bigger states. The per capita figures, which get closer to answering OP’s question, are used for the colors in Figure 2."

When interest rates rise (and income remains the same), this will raise the opportunity costs.

For example, public administration is an inter-disciplinary field which originally came from political science, but had a very heavy influence from micro economics. Public administration deals with public policy, government studies, administration/state bureaucracies, etc. Having an understanding of the basic of economics is really helpful. 

To quote Maserumule and Mashigo ([2014](https://www.aabri.com/manuscripts/09210.pdf)):

> Economics permeates each and every sector of human activity and interaction. It is
about how limited resources are used to create wealth. In the contemporary world, public
administration plays a critical role of providing direction in terms of how that wealth should
be distributed, although its involvement in the economy differs from one country to another
depending on a particular economic system at play. The public administrators are therefore
faced with the challenges of taking decisions within the context of economic realities of their
communities. They often make decisions in the face of limited resources. This is a
fundamental economic challenge. A sound knowledge of the fundamentals of economics is,
therefore, essential for all public administrators and policy makers in the business of
government. 
> The fundamentals of economics include, among others, inflation, unemployment,
poverty, national and international trades, fiscal and monetary policies, and the economic
behavior of households and organizations in the private and public sectors. 
> Engineers, lawyers, medical doctors, nurses, social workers and physicists, just to
mention but few, also invariably need some degree of understanding of economics to
efficiently carry out their specialized functions. Including economics as an “anchor subject”
in all set of courses that are being pursued for various professional and academic
qualifications in the social and natural sciences is a sound approach to curriculum
development as it would ensure that institutions of higher learning produces the caliber of
graduates that are well-rounded and could easily understand the economic dynamics that
underpin human actions.  

Anecdotally, there's often a disconnect between political scientists and economists, but this line tends to blur above undergraduate level significantly. Siloing from the paradigm wars is less of a thing, at least in the UK. And the rise of mixed methods across the social science is commonly seen as a net good ([Denzin, 2010](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1077800410364608)). It's often seen as a panacea depending on the discipline.  But the applicability of economic methods and theory really depends on the social phenomena under investigation and related research questions. Sometimes social phenomena can be heterogeneous, complex, nuanced, and bounded to particular historical-social-cultural instances which may make econometric modelling problematic ([Krauss, 2017](http://www.lse.ac.uk/philosophy/blog/2017/01/09/the-scientific-limits-of-understanding-complex-social-phenomena/)).  

On a further participatory democratic model having informed citizens, who understands the basics of economics, is also a common positive.

Edit: there's a lot of helpful and approachable resources nowadays for laymen too. I find The Curriculum Open-Access Resources in Economics Project ([CORE Project](https://www.core-econ.org/))'s stuff really great for a basic undergraduate understanding of theory. Similarly, [Econ Lib](https://www.econlib.org/) is a great freely accessible repository of seminal economic works, books and journals if you ever want to dip your toes in primary resources."

The reason for the high P/E ratio is because the Federal Funds rate was set so low for so long. The price of a stock is made up of it’s expected earnings and the interest rate at which it can service commercial paper. Most large company’s use commercial paper to finance short term spending or long term investments. That interest rate changes based on the federal funds rate. If the rate at which a company can borrow is low, then this would appreciate the stock and inflate the P/E ratio. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, it’s just the market valuing a company because of high potential growth. The negative effects would come from animal spirits, when there is a large dip in the market, but it’s just a correction and people panic sort of creating a self fulfilling prophecy."

* correlation != causation
* You're exactly right that growth is another way to earn returns from the market, and that's not accounted for in P/E.  It's typical now for things like large tech stocks (Amazon, Alphabet etc.) to never or almost never pay dividends.  When some of the hugest companies in the index don't pay dividends it tends to skew P/E a lot.  Looking at historical averages is less than indicative since this wasn't the case for much of the earlier part of history, so this approach is less than meaningful.
* Market prices for stocks are influenced by a number of external factors, including changes in supply/demand for non-stock investments (bonds, real estate etc.) and relative foreign investment in US stocks.  Stock markets and economic health only kind of track along with each other, and individual stocks even less so.
* Even if your hypothesis were correct (I don't think it is), if you discard the 2007 crisis as an extreme outlier, P/E is still in better shape than it was before the dotcom bust and the 9/11 slump, so there's two recent-ish occurrences that would tend to work against this assertion that P/E is cause for concern.

All of this said, I still don't have much smart to say about the current state of things.  We're in a truly weird time economically with a long expansion and historically low unemployment, near-zero interest rates *and* really low inflation all occurring together even as we're entering a self-inflicted trade war.  It's so strange that economists can't really even agree on what to make of it, and it might be years before we can look back and decide if we should have been worried."

Another thing to consider is the power of dollar cost averaging. Even if you start putting money in stocks during an overvalued market, you still do OK.

Capitalism has faults but it has lifted the most amount of people for the longest amount of time out of poverty.  Capitalism works for those willing to achieve.  Yes, some people fail due to things they can't control, we already help those people.  People who fail due their own doing deserve little in help and can only blame themselves.  Most people fall in the middle, and that's ok.

Rather than the government mandating high taxes and wealth redistribution we can achieve the same thing by lowering taxes across the board.  Keep the government out of the loop.

Love him or hate him Trumps tax policy is absolutely correct.  Large tax cuts for everyone and large cuts on corporate taxes.  Why corporate taxes you ask?  Because corporations don't actually pay that tax, the consumer does as a cost of doing business.  In reality corporate taxes should be zero.  This would have earth shattering effects to the economy.

177,AutoModerator,removecomment,2019-07-07 04:35:11,t1_et5hbso,"Lots to unpack here:

* correlation != causation
* You're exactly right that growth is another way to earn returns from the market, and that's not accounted for in P/E.  It's typical now for things like large tech stocks (Amazon, Alphabet etc.) to never or almost never pay dividends.  When some of the hugest companies in the index don't pay dividends it tends to skew P/E a lot.  Looking at historical averages is less than indicative since this wasn't the case for much of the earlier part of history, so this approach is less than meaningful.
* Market prices for stocks are influenced by a number of external factors, including changes in supply/demand for non-stock investments (bonds, real estate etc.) and relative foreign investment in US stocks.  Stock markets and economic health only kind of track along with each other, and individual stocks even less so.
* Even if your hypothesis were correct (I don't think it is), if you discard the 2007 crisis as an extreme outlier, P/E is still in better shape than it was before the dotcom bust and the 9/11 slump, so there's two recent-ish occurrences that would tend to work against this assertion that P/E is cause for concern.

All of this said, I still don't have much smart to say about the current state of things.  We're in a truly weird time economically with a long expansion and historically low unemployment, near-zero interest rates *and* really low inflation all occurring together even as we're entering a self-inflicted trade war.  It's so strange that economists can't really even agree on what to make of it, and it might be years before we can look back and decide if we should have been worried."
178,AutoModerator,removecomment,2019-07-07 04:03:53,t1_et5fbwh,"I share your concern, but I would argue that you’re just showing a correlation and not causality. The reason for the high P/E ratio is because the Federal Funds rate was set so low for so long. The price of a stock is made up of it’s expected earnings and the interest rate at which it can service commercial paper. Most large company’s use commercial paper to finance short term spending or long term investments. That interest rate changes based on the federal funds rate. If the rate at which a company can borrow is low, then this would appreciate the stock and inflate the P/E ratio. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, it’s just the market valuing a company because of high potential growth. The negative effects would come from animal spirits, when there is a large dip in the market, but it’s just a correction and people panic sort of creating a self fulfilling prophecy."

Capitalism has faults but it has lifted the most amount of people for the longest amount of time out of poverty.  Capitalism works for those willing to achieve.

&#x200B;

Information/knowledge is a public good, so once generated, it is very difficult to profit from (unless there are corrective policies like IP protection). This means that without intervention in the market, education/gaining information will be underinvested in. When a person gains education, they benefit but so does society because that person's labour will be more productive. Since information is a non-rivalrous good, it is more efficient to transmit information to as many people as possible at one time (ie. classrooms are more efficient than teaching each child individually). 

&#x200B;

Healthcare has similar features but is more complicated. First, healthy people are generally more productive than sick people and so society is more productive when the population is healthy. Depending on the issue, the negative externality of being sick is that you expose other to infection. In addition, the price elasticity for health is basically 0 -- meaning demand does not change as price increases. Reasons for this are complicated, but two important factors are: 

&#x200B;

\-  humans tend to value their lives more than money, so they will pay all the money they have for treatment if it will save their life

&#x200B;

\- most people don't pay the full costs of their own healthcare (insurance), so are less sensitive to underlying prices.

When the lack of price elasticity is combined with monopoly patent protections for new pharmaceuticals, prices can get very high, but this is not necessarily a market failure."

&#x200B;

There are many differences, for example small 'collectives' (like Nature's Bakery in Madison, WI with 8 employees) usually make decisions with meetings of all members, but large co-ops (like the Mondragon Cooperative in Spain with 80,000+ employees) elect a board of employees who hire a general manager who hires other managers.  In smaller worker co-ops or collectives, employees usually divide up responsibilities.

&#x200B;

\>  Could worker cooperatives be a good way to prevent inequality if there was a more effective way finance their start up? 

&#x200B;

Likely so, since there aren't exploitative executives or extractive capital and they focus on serving their members rather than maximizing profit. Capital is definitely an issue for co-ops, but the biggest hurdle is more people learning about co-ops, and collective entrepreneurship has its own challenges."

But I recently came across this [book review](https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/neoliberalism-world-order-review-quinn-slobodian-globalists) of the historian Adam Tooze, which provides an interesting narrative to some of the assumptions of Austrian economics.

>Torn apart by self-determination, the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Dual Monarchy in 1918 was not just the failure of a complex multinational polity. In the eyes of von Mises and his ideological allies, it threw into question the order of private property. It was the First World War and the Great Depression that birthed democratic nation-states, which no longer merely shielded private property but claimed control over a national economy conceived of as a resource to be supervised by the state. Private property that had once been secured by a remote but even-handed imperial sovereign was now at the mercy of national democracy.

>Faced with this shocking transformation, neoliberals set out not to demolish the state but to create an international order strong enough to contain the dangerous forces of democracy and encase the private economy in its own autonomous sphere.

>In the face of the Great Depression, they not only came to doubt the predictive power of business-cycle research, they came to see the very act of enumerating and counting “the economy” as itself a threat to the order of private property. It was when you conceived of the economy as an object, whether for purposes of scientific investigation or policy intervention, that you opened the door to redistributive, democratic economic policy. Following their own edicts, after crushing the labor movement, the next line of defense of private property was therefore to declare the economy unknowable.

>The entire point was to silence policy debate. By focusing on broad questions of the economic constitution, rather than the details of economic processes, neoliberals sought to outlaw prying questions about how things actually worked. It was when you started asking for statistics and assembling spreadsheets that you took the first dangerous step toward politicizing “the economy.”"

What I learned watching documentaries as well is that these alternatives farmings not only can produce more food for square meter, but also consume less water, less to no pesticides and have much less energy input. The traditional farming today consume more energy than what it produces (pesticides, tractors, irrigation, and so). It also increases biodiversity enriching the land with life while traditional farming literally kill all life in the land.

In other words, if the nominal wages didn't increase, the purchasing power would only be at (100/191,1) = ~52% of the base year. Basically the prices doubled, so you can only afford half of before. 

A salary cut off 91,1% would mean that that you are only earning 8,9% of what you've earned before. In this case your income would decrease by a factor of 11. 

To get an equivalent reduction of purchasing power through Inflation (if nominal wages stay constant) you can easily calculate as follows: 100/x=0,089  -->  x=100/0,089= 1123,6%

where x stands for the inflation compared to the base year.
Hope i could help.

Edit: to follow up on purchasing power: while the purchasing power of a currency often decreases over time (through higher prices), often nominal wages rise as well. So bluntly spoken, you get less for your Dollar, but you're earning more Dollars. If nominal income rises at the same rate as prices you are able to purchase as much as before. If nominal income rises faster than the prices your real income (income adjusted for price niveau) rises and vice versa."

We have to take a closer look at worker's compensation vs workers wages to see the bigger picture. You see, the wages Krugman used does not represent all workers. They only represent production workers, and it is misleading to not include the increasing amount of skilled workers thanks to the increasing access to education. Second, Krugman numbers doesn't taking into account other form of compensation such as employer-sponsored healthcare, safer work environment, unemployment insurance, food stamps, tax credits/deduction, and so on. When you adjust for these factors, what you will see is that real wages has gone up but it is still lower than gross production per worker per hour. Be careful with gross production because technology is playing a huge role in our production economy today. These technology depreciate, and when we adjust depreciation we get ""real"" gross production. All and done, worker's compensation has actually risen to match their productivity.

The traditional farming today consume more energy than what it produces (pesticides, tractors, irrigation, and so). It also increases biodiversity enriching the land with life while traditional farming literally kill all life in the land.

But I recently came across this [book review](https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/neoliberalism-world-order-review-quinn-slobodian-globalists) of the historian Adam Tooze, which provides an interesting narrative to some of the assumptions of Austrian economics.

>Torn apart by self-determination, the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Dual Monarchy in 1918 was not just the failure of a complex multinational polity. In the eyes of von Mises and his ideological allies, it threw into question the order of private property. It was the First World War and the Great Depression that birthed democratic nation-states, which no longer merely shielded private property but claimed control over a national economy conceived of as a resource to be supervised by the state. Private property that had once been secured by a remote but even-handed imperial sovereign was now at the mercy of national democracy.

>Faced with this shocking transformation, neoliberals set out not to demolish the state but to create an international order strong enough to contain the dangerous forces of democracy and encase the private economy in its own autonomous sphere.

>In the face of the Great Depression, they not only came to doubt the predictive power of business-cycle research, they came to see the very act of enumerating and counting “the economy” as itself a threat to the order of private property. It was when you conceived of the economy as an object, whether for purposes of scientific investigation or policy intervention, that you opened the door to redistributive, democratic economic policy. Following their own edicts, after crushing the labor movement, the next line of defense of private property was therefore to declare the economy unknowable.

>The entire point was to silence policy debate. By focusing on broad questions of the economic constitution, rather than the details of economic processes, neoliberals sought to outlaw prying questions about how things actually worked. It was when you started asking for statistics and assembling spreadsheets that you took the first dangerous step toward politicizing “the economy.”"

280,AutoModerator,removecomment,2019-07-05 19:47:35,t1_esz6dzp,"Healthcare and education are both markets with externalities, so it depends on what you mean by ""failure"". 

&#x200B;

Information/knowledge is a public good, so once generated, it is very difficult to profit from (unless there are corrective policies like IP protection). This means that without intervention in the market, education/gaining information will be underinvested in. When a person gains education, they benefit but so does society because that person's labour will be more productive. Since information is a non-rivalrous good, it is more efficient to transmit information to as many people as possible at one time (ie. classrooms are more efficient than teaching each child individually). 

&#x200B;

Healthcare has similar features but is more complicated. First, healthy people are generally more productive than sick people and so society is more productive when the population is healthy. Depending on the issue, the negative externality of being sick is that you expose other to infection. In addition, the price elasticity for health is basically 0 -- meaning demand does not change as price increases. Reasons for this are complicated, but two important factors are: 

&#x200B;

\-  humans tend to value their lives more than money, so they will pay all the money they have for treatment if it will save their life

&#x200B;

\- most people don't pay the full costs of their own healthcare (insurance), so are less sensitive to underlying prices.

&#x200B;

When the lack of price elasticity is combined with monopoly patent protections for new pharmaceuticals, prices can get very high, but this is not necessarily a market failure."

There are many differences, for example small 'collectives' (like Nature's Bakery in Madison, WI with 8 employees) usually make decisions with meetings of all members, but large co-ops (like the Mondragon Cooperative in Spain with 80,000+ employees) elect a board of employees who hire a general manager who hires other managers.

Likely so, since there aren't exploitative executives or extractive capital and they focus on serving their members rather than maximizing profit.

A salary cut off 91,1% would mean that that you are only earning 8,9% of what you've earned before. In this case your income would decrease by a factor of 11. 

To get an equivalent reduction of purchasing power through Inflation (if nominal wages stay constant) you can easily calculate as follows: 100/x=0,089  -->  x=100/0,089= 1123,6%

where x stands for the inflation compared to the base year.
Hope i could help.

Edit: to follow up on purchasing power: while the purchasing power of a currency often decreases over time (through higher prices), often nominal wages rise as well. So bluntly spoken, you get less for your Dollar, but you're earning more Dollars. If nominal income rises at the same rate as prices you are able to purchase as much as before. If nominal income rises faster than the prices your real income (income adjusted for price niveau) rises and vice versa."

We have to take a closer look at worker's compensation vs workers wages to see the bigger picture. You see, the wages Krugman used does not represent all workers. They only represent production workers, and it is misleading to not include the increasing amount of skilled workers thanks to the increasing access to education. Second, Krugman numbers doesn't taking into account other form of compensation such as employer-sponsored healthcare, safer work environment, unemployment insurance, food stamps, tax credits/deduction, and so on. When you adjust for these factors, what you will see is that real wages has gone up but it is still lower than gross production per worker per hour. Be careful with gross production because technology is playing a huge role in our production economy today. These technology depreciate, and when we adjust depreciation we get ""real"" gross production. All and done, worker's compensation has actually risen to match their productivity.

Of the 14 countries planning to join the Eco, 8 are already using the CFA franc, and would switch to the Eco. So the change would not be a big deal really. If it all goes as planned, we would go from 14 countries using CFA franc + 8 loose countries to 14 countries using Eco + 6 countries using the CFA franc. Not a huge change in and of itself, except for the fact that Nigeria would be joining the party, and Nigeria's economy is pretty big by African standards: [Nigeria's GDP is bigger than both Egypt's and South Africa's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_African_countries_by_GDP_(nominal\)).

The big question is, rather, would the Eco / CFA still be pegged to the Euro, be allowed to fluctuate under its own central bank (unlikely), be pegged to the USD (also unlikely), or be pegged to the Chinese Yuan (quite possible)? The answer to your question about the economic effects of the Eco for the member countries depends in large part on this big decision."
412,BainCapitalist,approvecomment,2019-07-03 17:24:19,t1_eso762m,"What a fun question!  Let's start with some quick groundwork before diving in.

Markets are just places where buyers and sellers exchange use-rights to things.  For example, when I bought my coffee this morning, I traded the use-right to the dollars in my hand for the use-right to (some of) the coffee in their pot.  We both agreed to the terms of the exchange, and we both walked away from the exchange happier.  What this means is that voluntary trade is mutually beneficial (or at least, going into it, we expect the trade to be mutually beneficial (Occasionally, we find out that we were wrong, which we just call ""ex post regret."").

Sometimes, though, two people's voluntary trade confers/imposes benefits/costs on other people.  This is most readily apparent with respect to pollution, where a factory that produces products but has pollution as a byproduct imposes costs on the surrounding neighborhood.  Or you can think of noise pollution as a thing, where just the sheer act of making noise is, itself, a cost that is imposed on someone.  Let's stick with noise pollution as our example.

My neighbors like to bounce a basketball on the ground and throw it vaguely toward a basketball hoop.  I know, I could have just said that they ""play basketball"" but that would be disingenuous to the sport - what they are doing cannot possibly be considered ""basketball.""  They especially like to do this late at night in the summer time and their driveway is right next to our bedroom window, which we like to have open because it's hot out!  Now, I'm an economics professor and I'm not teaching any summer courses this year, so I don't really mind the lack of sleep because I can just sleep in later.  My wife on the other hand is a surgeon and she operates at 7:00 AM sharp (and on kids!).  She needs the sleep so she can do the best work possible.

In an unregulated world, I suspect that my neighbors would be outside until 3:00 AM every night doing their thing.  But my city has a noise ordinance, which states very clearly that the hours between 11:00 PM and 7:00 AM are designated as ""quiet hours.""  We can think of this ordinance as a form of a regulation, which puts limits on my neighbors' behavior.  Sure, I could just walk over there and ask them nicely to be quiet, but depending on the situation, that can be socially awkward.  This ordinance prevents this.

In a more serious example, we (in the US) have regulations in place that ensure that the workplace is safe (OSHA).  This basically says that your place of employment will be pretty damn safe and that your employer cannot ask you to do anything that would be considered ""unsafe."" 

We in the US also regulate organ donation in an attempt to prevent people from stealing/harvesting organs from other people but also to prevent people from making decisions that might help in the short run (getting money for e.g. a kidney) but have long term health consequences that they might not be fully aware of (the increased chance of renal failure).

The benefits of regulation are pretty clear: they keep people safe and they help prevent ""bad"" behavior.

The costs of regulation are less clear.  For one, enforcing those regulations is itself costly.  Second, in many cases, the regulations prevent what would otherwise be voluntary trade, which as we said earlier, is mutually beneficial.  For example, the FDA up until recently did not allow terminally ill patients to use experimental drugs unless they were part of the study.  While this may keep people safe in general, with terminally ill patients, it sometimes condemned them to death without even being able to ""throw up a Hail Mary,"" so to speak.  And sometimes, everyone (including the FDA!) knew that the drug was safe and worked, but it hadn't gotten all the signatures yet and so the patient still couldn't receive the treatment.  This is really sad and is a cost of ""regulation.""

As economists, we would weigh the likely (marginal) benefits against the likely (marginal) costs and determine what to do from there.  This might be gauche in some situations, but it might also not be in others.

For what it's worth, and since you asked for our insights, I personally think we're too quick to jump to ""there's a problem, we must regulate it away!"" I think that there are other, private solutions to the problems that regulation purports to solve that might be much, much more efficient.  Ronald Coase has some [great insights here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coase_theorem), with the idea that people can simply bargain over ""property rights.""  Burt Folsom also wrote a great book called *The Myth of the Robber Barons*, where he details e.g. Rockefeller's success as a function of him cleaning up rivers by using the sludge that refining oil produced to make wax candles, paraffin wax, etc.

Am I saying that the optimal number of regulations is zero?  Of course not; that would be silly.  But someone once referred to regulation as the result of a moral failure of society.  I think that's appropriate."

The difference was that the central bank could not simply just buy Swiss government bonds to implement QE. The reason being that there just aren't enough Swiss government bonds around. They had to buy a lot of foreign government bonds and fx reserves as well.

But this is a general issue not necessarily limited to QE. The central bank's balance sheet was full of foreign assets even before QE, and even in the Swiss franc secured interbank market foreign assets are accepted as collateral. This is in contrast to the USA and EU, that limit eligible assets (as collateral or for QE purchases) to domestic assets (I don't know about Japan).

It is not so much the size of the economy that matters, but the size of the banking industry. Switzerland has a huge banking industry and hence needed a large QE intervention compared to its economy. Hence, exclusively buying assets from its own economy was not an option. It would have severely disrupted financial markets. You can't just buy 30-70% of an asset and expect markets to carry on as if it didn't happen, but with lower rates. The ECB thinks otherwise, and that's why they now lost grip on their money market interest rates ([check figure 1 and keep in mind that the dashed line constitutes the lower bound of their interest rate corridor](https://www.imf.org/~/media/Files/Publications/WP/2018/wp18258.ashx))."

Gates assets are more diversified, he only owns about 1% of Microsoft, and with the rest of the money, he did exactly what you suggest. He gave money to companies (in return for shares of those companies). That's literally the entire point of shares, companies sell a part of their company, a share, and take that money to finance their business. Although details are undisclosed, Gates most likely funds quite a lot of companies that way.

Just as a sidenote, this is called equity financing (instead of debt financing, taking out loans). You're selling what you have, so in this case, your company, or a portion of it. This isn't quite that literal, imagine it as the right to own a slice of a pie, but everyone who also owns the right to a slice of the pie has to agree on whether to eat it or sell it or throw it out or whatever.

Companies can raise money and control their shares. They can buyback shares, which for simplicities sake let's say just get destroyed, but since you then have less shares, and everybody who owns a share owns a larger part of the company, they get more valuable. You own a bigger part of the pie now. Or they can issue new shares, so go and sell smaller slices of the pie, which means of course that each slice will be a bit less valuable, but also that people who want a ""new"" slice will have to pay the company directly.

Oh, and not to mention, of course most of the time stock is not traded between people and the company, but between stockholders and other people.

Let's go back to Bezos. Another thing you suggest is that his wealth takes away from company money, taxes, wages, etc. That's not quite how it works.

Let's say you own a company, a lemonade stand. Let's say everything you need to operate that stand was gifted to you. You work for a while, make a profit, and eventually make enough to open a second stand. You still own both stands. Any costs are paid from the income your company makes selling lemonade.

This continues, your company grows, and because it grows and has more and more income, it becomes more valuable. You're still the owner of everything. Your lemonade business is eventually worth billions of dollars.

And since you own it, *you* are worth billions of dollars. That never required you to take any money out of the business, or really have your personal finances interact or influence company finances at all. You're simply rich because you own a valuable company (well, and apparently did a good job building a lemonade empire). Your wealth grew because the value of the company grew. And the value of the company grew because it sold a lot of lemonade."
422,BainCapitalist,removecomment,2019-07-03 17:20:07,t1_eskps94,"I’m not an economist so don’t know if I’m allowed to answer (I am a lawyer with a poly sci undergrad so have had a lot of intro economics and politics theory type economics). 

The way I think about it is it is about the right amount of regulation - like a game that needs rules to make the game work, but too many rules big it down. Ever seen that old commercial with 100 people trying to play tennis on the same court? It doesn’t work. That’s a deregulated market. It doesn’t work. 

Pros of deregulation CAN be lower barriers to entry which improves competition. But the flip side is that the deregulation can lead to monopolies, collusion among existing companies on the market that leads to artificial pricing and higher barriers to entry. Complete deregulation allows companies to offload negative externalities in society (dumping waste into public land, water, air, etc., hurting the population and depleting natural resources without having to pay for those side effects).  Deregulation can drive up economic disparities - if we were all on a desert island don’t you think the guy with 5X more stuff then everyone else would quickly be able to use his wealth coupled with everyone else’s need to survive to hoard wealth and gain 10X as much as everyone else?

Pros of a regulated market include consumer health and safety, worker protections, and requiring companies to pay for the negative effects they cause on all of us. 

The downside of regulation comes if it is heavy handed and not done correctly - barriers to entry become too high for new players, so there is no competition, which lets suppliers drive prices up. It can become too expensive for businesses to comply, which either drives up prices or constricts business that would otherwise grow."
423,BainCapitalist,approvecomment,2019-07-03 17:19:53,t1_eske85w,"Both regulation and deregulation/lack of regulation can make a market more or less efficient, or steer the market towards more desirable outcomes. No economist would make blanket statements about regulation in general being good or bad.

Markets don't always do everything they ""should"" on their own. One pretty important example right now are externalities. To be precise, the externalities of emissions. Externalities are costs incurred by parties who didn't chose to incur them. You didn't chose to incur the negative effects from the emissions of a factory on the other side of the world, yet you are affected by them. One possible solution to migitate that is to *make* the factory incur the cost, by for example putting a price on emissions that the factory has to pay. That's a ""good"" regulation, because it internalises the externality and makes the cost of a product reflect the actual cost of producing it more accurately.

Of course, there are ""bad"" regulations as well. Take for example rent control. The goal of rent control is usually to stabilise prices of rent controlled apartments. And indeed that's what rent control does. But it also leads to a laundry list of adverse effects. It discourages new housing from being build, it discourages landlords from maintaining their property, it leads to higher rent for adjacent property not under rent control, and other issues. Basically, it makes the underlying problem of a lack of supply worse, leads to other issues and only benefits a small group of people, and even those see some detrimental effects.

Then of course you have regulations that aren't necessarily efficient but are used for other reasons. Some countries for example have free colleges for everybody. That's not necessarily efficient because there *are* people who could afford to pay the ""full"" price but don't. You're giving them a free ride for no good reason (from an economics perspective). These countries still chose to have free college simply because they are fine with incurring that extra cost and basically just like it that way more, for one reason or another.

Besides all that, economics is mainly focused on looking bat what happens and what would happen if you do something (like implementing a regulation). It's not concerned with if what happens is good or bad, it just aims to understand and describe."
424,AutoModerator,removecomment,2019-07-03 17:14:42,t1_esotrtw,"FYI, 14 countries in central and western Africa have been using a single currency since 1945, the [CFA franc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFA_franc). Of the 14 countries planning to join the Eco, 8 are already using the CFA franc, and would switch to the Eco. So the change would not be a big deal really. If it all goes as planned, we would go from 14 countries using CFA franc + 8 loose countries to 14 countries using Eco + 6 countries using the CFA franc. Not a huge change in and of itself, except for the fact that Nigeria would be joining the party, and Nigeria's economy is pretty big by African standards: [Nigeria's GDP is bigger than both Egypt's and South Africa's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_African_countries_by_GDP_(nominal\)).

The big question is, rather, would the Eco / CFA still be pegged to the Euro, be allowed to fluctuate under its own central bank (unlikely), be pegged to the USD (also unlikely), or be pegged to the Chinese Yuan (quite possible)? The answer to your question about the economic effects of the Eco for the member countries depends in large part on this big decision."

Baked goods are cheap, and they don't last well either so you have to produce often, no one wants to shop at grocery stores that run out of bread, and regulatory requirements mean that unsold inventory is no longer profitable even if it's still edible.

A longer answer concerns things like [Economic Order Quantity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economicorderquantity.asp).  And although that math makes it looks neat and pretty, reliably estimating some of those variables like demanded quantity gets tough to do in practice.

The bigger societal problem with food waste is the stuff that winds up in dumpsters and garbage disposals instead of getting eaten; donating unsold goods isn't exactly ""waste"" per se.  They might actually be saving money by donating it instead of having to dispose of it, even without tax incentives or such."

440,AutoModerator,removecomment,2019-07-03 13:42:12,t1_eso762m,"What a fun question!  Let's start with some quick groundwork before diving in.

Markets are just places where buyers and sellers exchange use-rights to things.  For example, when I bought my coffee this morning, I traded the use-right to the dollars in my hand for the use-right to (some of) the coffee in their pot.  We both agreed to the terms of the exchange, and we both walked away from the exchange happier.  What this means is that voluntary trade is mutually beneficial (or at least, going into it, we expect the trade to be mutually beneficial (Occasionally, we find out that we were wrong, which we just call ""ex post regret."").

Sometimes, though, two people's voluntary trade confers/imposes benefits/costs on other people.  This is most readily apparent with respect to pollution, where a factory that produces products but has pollution as a byproduct imposes costs on the surrounding neighborhood.  Or you can think of noise pollution as a thing, where just the sheer act of making noise is, itself, a cost that is imposed on someone.  Let's stick with noise pollution as our example.

My neighbors like to bounce a basketball on the ground and throw it vaguely toward a basketball hoop.  I know, I could have just said that they ""play basketball"" but that would be disingenuous to the sport - what they are doing cannot possibly be considered ""basketball.""  They especially like to do this late at night in the summer time and their driveway is right next to our bedroom window, which we like to have open because it's hot out!  Now, I'm an economics professor and I'm not teaching any summer courses this year, so I don't really mind the lack of sleep because I can just sleep in later.  My wife on the other hand is a surgeon and she operates at 7:00 AM sharp (and on kids!).  She needs the sleep so she can do the best work possible.

In an unregulated world, I suspect that my neighbors would be outside until 3:00 AM every night doing their thing.  But my city has a noise ordinance, which states very clearly that the hours between 11:00 PM and 7:00 AM are designated as ""quiet hours.""  We can think of this ordinance as a form of a regulation, which puts limits on my neighbors' behavior.  Sure, I could just walk over there and ask them nicely to be quiet, but depending on the situation, that can be socially awkward.  This ordinance prevents this.

In a more serious example, we (in the US) have regulations in place that ensure that the workplace is safe (OSHA).  This basically says that your place of employment will be pretty damn safe and that your employer cannot ask you to do anything that would be considered ""unsafe."" 

We in the US also regulate organ donation in an attempt to prevent people from stealing/harvesting organs from other people but also to prevent people from making decisions that might help in the short run (getting money for e.g. a kidney) but have long term health consequences that they might not be fully aware of (the increased chance of renal failure).

The benefits of regulation are pretty clear: they keep people safe and they help prevent ""bad"" behavior.

The costs of regulation are less clear.  For one, enforcing those regulations is itself costly.  Second, in many cases, the regulations prevent what would otherwise be voluntary trade, which as we said earlier, is mutually beneficial.  For example, the FDA up until recently did not allow terminally ill patients to use experimental drugs unless they were part of the study.  While this may keep people safe in general, with terminally ill patients, it sometimes condemned them to death without even being able to ""throw up a Hail Mary,"" so to speak.  And sometimes, everyone (including the FDA!) knew that the drug was safe and worked, but it hadn't gotten all the signatures yet and so the patient still couldn't receive the treatment.  This is really sad and is a cost of ""regulation.""

As economists, we would weigh the likely (marginal) benefits against the likely (marginal) costs and determine what to do from there.  This might be gauche in some situations, but it might also not be in others.

For what it's worth, and since you asked for our insights, I personally think we're too quick to jump to ""there's a problem, we must regulate it away!"" I think that there are other, private solutions to the problems that regulation purports to solve that might be much, much more efficient.  Ronald Coase has some [great insights here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coase_theorem), with the idea that people can simply bargain over ""property rights.""  Burt Folsom also wrote a great book called *The Myth of the Robber Barons*, where he details e.g. Rockefeller's success as a function of him cleaning up rivers by using the sludge that refining oil produced to make wax candles, paraffin wax, etc.

Am I saying that the optimal number of regulations is zero?  Of course not; that would be silly.  But someone once referred to regulation as the result of a moral failure of society.  I think that's appropriate."

The difference was that the central bank could not simply just buy Swiss government bonds to implement QE. The reason being that there just aren't enough Swiss government bonds around. They had to buy a lot of foreign government bonds and fx reserves as well.

But this is a general issue not necessarily limited to QE. The central bank's balance sheet was full of foreign assets even before QE, and even in the Swiss franc secured interbank market foreign assets are accepted as collateral. This is in contrast to the USA and EU, that limit eligible assets (as collateral or for QE purchases) to domestic assets (I don't know about Japan).

It is not so much the size of the economy that matters, but the size of the banking industry. Switzerland has a huge banking industry and hence needed a large QE intervention compared to its economy. Hence, exclusively buying assets from its own economy was not an option. It would have severely disrupted financial markets. You can't just buy 30-70% of an asset and expect markets to carry on as if it didn't happen, but with lower rates.

Granted, even at Wal-Mart you don't get too see how your sausage is made.
But an Amazon purchase is even further removed you just click some buttons, there and in no time it is delivered to you in the comfort of your own home.  

Generally speaking, the more convenience you have, the harder someone else is working for you for less money.  Because of outsourcing and the economy that supports it, there is no chance for ""true cost"" economics.  And you can only live above your means for so long before you go bankrupt, and as a nation and add a global economy, that's where we are headed.

EDIT:

For anyone that doesn't know, BainCapitalist is a well versed and knowledgeable economics commentator here.

Which is why this is so absurd.

First off, his link was about corporate taxes, and I think its fair to say that corporate taxes can be viewed as a double tax. There is significant animosity towards corporate taxes in the economics world, and you can find articles and statements from people like Paul Krugman (Nobel prize winning 500lb gorilla of the economics world) condemning corporate taxes.

The question however, was about taxes on capital gains.

Doesn't take much to see that capital gains are completely different from corporate taxes. Capital gains are also taxes on new income, and that new investment income isn't taxed twice, and I don't think there's even a shred of a convincing sounding argument for claiming otherwise.

So either BainCapitalist mistakenly thought my post was referencing corporate taxes, in which case, fair enough, or I have to question his integrity both for claiming that capital gains are an example of double taxation and for linking a thread about corporate taxes as a means of backing that claim up.

EDIT 2:

Just read through his post, and his argument seems to be that if you place a tax on something that returns compound interest, then the tax is too high because the tax effectively reduces the interest rate which grows money exponentially, so by reducing the exponent at which your money grows exponentially any tax on any return which is compounded is too high.

Those of you that are following this will hopefully see that this is nonsense. Taxes aren't doubled taxes just because they effectively reduce the return on investment, and the return of investment gets compounded such that the amount of money you lose through the tax grows exponentially year over year.

Its also not why corporate taxes are claimed to be a double tax. They're claimed to be double taxes because they're applied in addition to later income or capital gains taxes paid by the owners of the company.

Proponents of UBI say its a much better way of ensuring people get some minimum level of benefit than welfare. The reason is because of [welfare traps.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare_trap) Essentially, because welfare takes so long to get approved for, and because it is revoked when you get any employment, there is an incentive to refuse some forms of employment that are offered to you while on welfare. You wouldn't take a part-time job unless it paid you more than your welfare, and if you thought the job was seasonal you would just stay on welfare. UBI gets rid of this perverse incentive by paying you a fixed stipend regardless of your employment status. Even some free-market economists have proposed a form of UBI. Look at Milton Friedman's [negative income tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_income_tax).

A tax cut by definition only affects those that are paying taxes. This is not necessarily a bad thing, as people and corporations who pay taxes are productive members of society. When taxes are cut people have more disposable income. People either save this disposable income or spend it. When they spend it, it goes directly back into the economy as consumption. And because one person's spending is another person's income a chain reaction occurs that raises everyone's income. This is called the [multiplier effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplier_(economics)). When they save it get injected back into the economy in the form of investment. Generally this goes out in the form of new loans, which lowers interest rates and/or makes funding available to projects that wouldn't have otherwise had it. Or it can go into capital investment like purchasing stock. High stock prices provide a return on investment for shareholders which they can either spend or save. In addition, the shareholder returns attract new competitors and provide a funding source for company acquisitions. Acquisitions are good for innovation because they provide a funding source (exit) for startups.

The argument of which one is better is not an easy one to answer. Similar arguments to this one pop up in policy debate all the time. We call this debate [supply side](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply-side_economics) and [demand side](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand-side_economics) economics. Instead of giving you my view, let me show you how you would evaluate what questions you need to ask to determine which policy has more merit. The first thing we need to do is list all the potential consequences of both actions (good or bad) and then later on assign a weight to it.

**UBI:**

* Removes welfare trap (+)
* Helps low income families, reducing [externalities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality) like crime (+)
* Would likely raise inflation (-)
* Reduces administrative burden of social programs (+)

**Tax cuts**

* Reduces [deadweight loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excess_burden_of_taxation) (+)
* Results in more investment (+)
* Result in more consumption (+)
* Would likely raise inflation (-)
* Lowers government revenues (-)

UBI: Alright, so now we need to figure out the tangible benefit of removing the welfare trap, lowering externalities and the reduced admin burden and see if that outweighs the cost of inflation. Since more people are adding value in the economy, people are removed from low-value admin, and less crime is being committed, any potential inflation should be countered from the increased output through this policy. Its important that we did this, because a lot of Government spending is inflationary. Its inflationary when the benefit to society is less than the cost of implementing the policy and has a real negative multiplier. See [broken window fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_broken_window).

Tax cuts: alright, so does the improvement in projects funded, increased investment and increased consumption make up for the potentially higher inflation and lost government revenues? Well since more output is being produced by new projects, more projects are being funded with lending and IPOs, and stock prices are going up this should counteract the inflationary forces. Now we have to determine was the money better off in the hands of the government or the hands of the people. Generally the money is better spent in the hands of the people, because it is easier for people to find value-added projects in millions of small microcosms than for the central government to manage changes in these small communities. However, infrastructure investments are also essential to the strength of the economy. To solve this last question we need to study the effectiveness of 1 dollar of government spending vs. 1 dollar of private sector spending and determine which spending has the higher economic output. Once we solve this question then we will have a factual basis to form our opinions.

It should be noted, you could probably have some combination of both tax cuts and UBI to maximize efficiency. It doesn't have to be one or the other. This process is also iterative. I may have forgotten an effect, made an assumption, or maybe the variables change or are not linear ie: [laffer curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laffer_curve). This is not a static model, which is why we need to test our hypothesis through regression in multiple markets over multiple time periods to become confident in the answers. This is why you shouldn't take one economic study too seriously if you see them in the news. There are many variables to control for, and its impossible for one study to prove an economic relationship."

First your statement is so general, we really need a source.  So just explanation purposes lets go by [this article](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/58-americans-less-1-000-090000503.html).  The study was done by GoBankingRates.  It asked the question of 5,000 people ""How much do you have in a savings account?""   58% of responders said less than $1,000.  I think the specificity of ""in a savings account"" makes the question fairly irrelevant.

&#x200B;

I would fall in the 42% that does not have that much in a savings account. In fact, I don't have a savings account.  Rates are so low it doesn't hurt me much to keep extra in my checking account and when there is too much in there I transfer it to my online investment account that pays a better rate on cash than a standard bank account.  Though I will caveat this with the fact that cash in an investment account on the most technical level usually is considered a savings account, but almost no one is going to think of that when they answer this question.  For a very long time there has been pretty no incentive (interest rate)  to keep funds in an actual savings account."

They don't, that's the point.  They are ""ascribed"" less worth, that's the point of outsourcing.  Businesses obviously don't export their production for the sake of diversity or cultural exchange, they do it because they have ""ascribed"" lesser wealth to another community and/or don't want to directly deal with the economic or environmental fallout of their capital venture.

Functionally, buying from Walmart and buying on Amazon are about the same.  The goods you get are at either place are made, for the most part, in other countries.   Which would be legit in an actually free market, until you consider our history of violence in global trade negotiation. 

Or most capital ventures, if you break them down.  However, buying from Amazon is one step further removed from having to confront the reality of economic inequality.    U don't have to go to the warehouse where the pay minimum wage yourself, and look into the eyes of the workers, and say to yourself, ""wow, I'm glad I don't work here"", and also, at the same time, ""geez this is really a steal, thank God for these low low prices. This is totally fine.""

Granted, even at Wal-Mart you don't get too see how your sausage is made.
But an Amazon purchase is even further removed you just click some buttons, there and in no time it is delivered to you in the comfort of your own home.  

Generally speaking, the more convenience you have, the harder someone else is working for you for less money.  Because of outsourcing and the economy that supports it, there is no chance for ""true cost"" economics.  And you can only live above your means for so long before you go bankrupt, and as a nation and add a global economy, that's where we are headed.

So no, the two places are not much different, but also Amazon is one step closer to poverty for everyone (even for the people in the Amazon sites, apparently) and is bad for our economy in the long run, and not just symbolically.  I'm not against capitalism, I'm just not okay with it as it stands"
516,AutoModerator,removecomment,2019-07-02 20:49:42,t1_esm8z85,"It seems like you're under the impression that these people just have this money lying around somewhere.

That's not how it works. The vast majority of this money *is* in the hands of other people, companies, etc. Because they don't have their wealth in money, they have it in *assets*. Most likely the majority in financial products like stocks (Bezos definitely does, no idea about Gates in detail).

Most of Bezos' wealth is in Amazon stocks, so not money, but something he can exchange for money. If he were to get rid of those, someone else would have to give up their money. Amazon could buy them (although since that would be a bit fishy, with him being the owner and all that, but ignoring that for a minute) which would mean Amazon would have *less* money to grow, employ people, etc.

Gates assets are more diversified, he only owns about 1% of Microsoft, and with the rest of the money, he did exactly what you suggest. He gave money to companies (in return for shares of those companies). That's literally the entire point of shares, companies sell a part of their company, a share, and take that money to finance their business. Although details are undisclosed, Gates most likely funds quite a lot of companies that way.

Just as a sidenote, this is called equity financing (instead of debt financing, taking out loans). You're selling what you have, so in this case, your company, or a portion of it. This isn't quite that literal, imagine it as the right to own a slice of a pie, but everyone who also owns the right to a slice of the pie has to agree on whether to eat it or sell it or throw it out or whatever.

Companies can raise money and control their shares. They can buyback shares, which for simplicities sake let's say just get destroyed, but since you then have less shares, and everybody who owns a share owns a larger part of the company, they get more valuable. You own a bigger part of the pie now. Or they can issue new shares, so go and sell smaller slices of the pie, which means of course that each slice will be a bit less valuable, but also that people who want a ""new"" slice will have to pay the company directly.

Oh, and not to mention, of course most of the time stock is not traded between people and the company, but between stockholders and other people.

Let's go back to Bezos. Another thing you suggest is that his wealth takes away from company money, taxes, wages, etc. That's not quite how it works.

Let's say you own a company, a lemonade stand. Let's say everything you need to operate that stand was gifted to you. You work for a while, make a profit, and eventually make enough to open a second stand. You still own both stands. Any costs are paid from the income your company makes selling lemonade.

This continues, your company grows, and because it grows and has more and more income, it becomes more valuable. You're still the owner of everything. Your lemonade business is eventually worth billions of dollars.

And since you own it, *you* are worth billions of dollars. That never required you to take any money out of the business, or really have your personal finances interact or influence company finances at all. You're simply rich because you own a valuable company (well, and apparently did a good job building a lemonade empire). Your wealth grew because the value of the company grew. And the value of the company grew because it sold a lot of lemonade."

Suppose you were choosing between purchasing the exact same product at the same price from your local Walmart or from Amazon. Buying it in person at Walmart drives up demand for Walmart's products and supports the employees who work there. But it also costs you time (and assuming you get there by driving also requires you to consume gasoline, emit CO2, put wear on your vehicle and the roads it travels on). If you buy it from Amazon, you can save that time and those resources (although having it delivered also consumes gasoline, wear on roads, emits CO2 but those costs are borne by Amazon). What do you do with that extra time is up to you, but what if you used all the extra time you saved buying from Amazon to do things that help support your local economy even more than shopping at Walmart?

Here's a thought experiment to help understand why this is hard to answer. Suppose you were choosing between purchasing the exact same product at the same price from your local Walmart or from Amazon. Buying it in person at Walmart drives up demand for Walmart's products and supports the employees who work there. But it also costs you time (and assuming you get there by driving also requires you to consume gasoline, emit CO2, put wear on your vehicle and the roads it travels on). If you buy it from Amazon, you can save that time and those resources (although having it delivered also consumes gasoline, wear on roads, emits CO2 but those costs are borne by Amazon). What do you do with that extra time is up to you, but what if you used all the extra time you saved buying from Amazon to do things that help support your local economy even more than shopping at Walmart? If that were the case, buying from Amazon would be ""better"" for your local economy.

Talking about it in general globally... In the past the buildings in the city center were usually old and it was cheaper to build new modern structures in the suburbs than renovate the old buildings in the city center, so it became unattractive for the fancy people and cheap.
 Artists and small start ups usually go to places where they can afford (cheap) but is not isolated so they can do their business. While in the past people with more money would rather live in the suburbs where it would be considered safer, cleaner and better financial investment. The poor people rather live near their jobs which are concentrated in the city center.

But then artists and start ups starts to succeed, become famous, brandy and so. Their life style in the old buildings architecture and in the city center becomes trendy, and others who want live near where there are artists and cultural stuff going on also look forwards live near them. So the city starts to attract fancy people and the prices go up.

But the worsening of all is the speculation that turns houses/property as not a place to live but a thing to hold while prices goes up and sell to cash in. For this reason there are many empty homes in major cities. Also rent the house to travellers becomes more attractive than rent to people who want live in it."

The way I think about it is it is about the right amount of regulation - like a game that needs rules to make the game work, but too many rules big it down. Ever seen that old commercial with 100 people trying to play tennis on the same court? It doesn’t work. That’s a deregulated market. It doesn’t work. 

Pros of deregulation CAN be lower barriers to entry which improves competition. But the flip side is that the deregulation can lead to monopolies, collusion among existing companies on the market that leads to artificial pricing and higher barriers to entry. Complete deregulation allows companies to offload negative externalities in society (dumping waste into public land, water, air, etc., hurting the population and depleting natural resources without having to pay for those side effects).  Deregulation can drive up economic disparities - if we were all on a desert island don’t you think the guy with 5X more stuff then everyone else would quickly be able to use his wealth coupled with everyone else’s need to survive to hoard wealth and gain 10X as much as everyone else?

Pros of a regulated market include consumer health and safety, worker protections, and requiring companies to pay for the negative effects they cause on all of us. 

The downside of regulation comes if it is heavy handed and not done correctly - barriers to entry become too high for new players, so there is no competition, which lets suppliers drive prices up. It can become too expensive for businesses to comply, which either drives up prices or constricts business that would otherwise grow."

No economist would make blanket statements about regulation in general being good or bad.

Markets don't always do everything they ""should"" on their own. One pretty important example right now are externalities. To be precise, the externalities of emissions. Externalities are costs incurred by parties who didn't chose to incur them. You didn't chose to incur the negative effects from the emissions of a factory on the other side of the world, yet you are affected by them. One possible solution to migitate that is to *make* the factory incur the cost, by for example putting a price on emissions that the factory has to pay. That's a ""good"" regulation, because it internalises the externality and makes the cost of a product reflect the actual cost of producing it more accurately.

Of course, there are ""bad"" regulations as well. Take for example rent control. The goal of rent control is usually to stabilise prices of rent controlled apartments. And indeed that's what rent control does. But it also leads to a laundry list of adverse effects. It discourages new housing from being build, it discourages landlords from maintaining their property, it leads to higher rent for adjacent property not under rent control, and other issues. Basically, it makes the underlying problem of a lack of supply worse, leads to other issues and only benefits a small group of people, and even those see some detrimental effects.

Then of course you have regulations that aren't necessarily efficient but are used for other reasons. Some countries for example have free colleges for everybody. That's not necessarily efficient because there *are* people who could afford to pay the ""full"" price but don't. You're giving them a free ride for no good reason (from an economics perspective). These countries still chose to have free college simply because they are fine with incurring that extra cost and basically just like it that way more, for one reason or another.

Besides all that, economics is mainly focused on looking bat what happens and what would happen if you do something (like implementing a regulation). It's not concerned with if what happens is good or bad, it just aims to understand and describe."

Baked goods are cheap, and they don't last well either so you have to produce often, no one wants to shop at grocery stores that run out of bread, and regulatory requirements mean that unsold inventory is no longer profitable even if it's still edible.

A longer answer concerns things like [Economic Order Quantity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economicorderquantity.asp).  And although that math makes it looks neat and pretty, reliably estimating some of those variables like demanded quantity gets tough to do in practice.

The bigger societal problem with food waste is the stuff that winds up in dumpsters and garbage disposals instead of getting eaten; donating unsold goods isn't exactly ""waste"" per se.  They might actually be saving money by donating it instead of having to dispose of it, even without tax incentives or such."

This culminated in the early 90s, when urban crime also peaked.

But when I was in college in the 90s, something shifted and younger people started to want to live in cities instead of burbs. I was in San Francisco, which was very gritty, but cheap for a while.

Talking about it in general globally... In the past the buildings in the city center were usually old and it was cheaper to build new modern structures in the suburbs than renovate the old buildings in the city center, so it became unattractive for the fancy people and cheap.
 Artists and small start ups usually go to places where they can afford (cheap) but is not isolated so they can do their business. While in the past people with more money would rather live in the suburbs where it would be considered safer, cleaner and better financial investment. The poor people rather live near their jobs which are concentrated in the city center.

But then artists and start ups starts to succeed, become famous, brandy and so. Their life style in the old buildings architecture and in the city center becomes trendy, and others who want live near where there are artists and cultural stuff going on also look forwards live near them. So the city starts to attract fancy people and the prices go up.

But the worsening of all is the speculation that turns houses/property as not a place to live but a thing to hold while prices goes up and sell to cash in. For this reason there are many empty homes in major cities. Also rent the house to travellers becomes more attractive than rent to people who want live in it."

In general, the first step is picking which journals to submit to, this shouldn't be too hard as the obvious first ones to consider are journals of papers you have or will cite. Then submitting the finishes document and with any other supplements they require. After this it goes to the editor and can be desk rejected, after this if it  is not desk rejected it goes to referees. The referees will read the paper over, make comments and decide to accept, reject, or request a revise and resubmit. If I recall the final call is the editor. Accepted and rejected is fairly obvious, The revise and resubmit means they want you to add or make changes based on questions and concerns of the referees.

Much of /u/celestia_keaton's question can be answered with a popularity/gentrification cycle (especially since they mention LA vs somewhere like the bay area where housing restrictions are huge).

I'm not an LA expert, but a lot of cities had a big white-flight starting in the 1950s and [LA was not immune](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/238429704_Escape_From_Los_Angeles_White_Flight_from_Los_Angeles_and_Its_Schools_1960-1980).  The wealthy fled to the suburbs.  Often the jobs eventually followed them (including places like Orange County).

A lot of those neighborhoods fell apart as people left, but over time, people wanted to come back.  The artists, often the childen of the white-flight suburbanites wanted the urban experience.  They couldn't afford the remaining nice areas in the city, so they chose the areas that weren't terrible but were still affordable.  As more of them moved in, the neighborhoods got safer and cooler.  

Now you have this cool neighborhood where all the artists are.  Restaurants/coffee shops open up there to serve them.  Non-artists come and visit.  Yuppies looking to save a buck move in too since it is now a cool neighborhood.  Maybe it doesn't have good schools, but that's years away for a young couple (or single person).

More of those people move in, the artists start to get priced out and move somewhere else.  Schools improve a bit and now people don't all leave when they have kids.  Now its not even an ""artsy"" neighborhood anymore, so ""squares"" all move in.  Prices keep going up.  If I have time later, I will edit this into a better comment rather than a stream of consciousness description...

TL;DR: White people with money leave, immigrants/minorities/poor people move in, artists need place to stay and want to be in the city so they start to move in, yuppies think it is cool to live near artists and follow, price goes up so artists leave, frat boys move in since it is now just a neighborhood with lots of nightlife."

Significantly lower *than what*? If prices were lower than what they are, you would be asking why they aren't even lower than that.

By the logic of your question, it would follow that as long as there is *any* waste, the only possible equilibrium price is zero... but this obviously contradicts experience.

654,Serialk,approvecomment,2019-07-01 12:47:29,t1_esgvod9,"Absolutely not. In fact there's an entire model called Directed Technical Change (Acemoglu 1995) which is dedicated to explaining why both wages and supply of high skilled labour have been increasing in developed countries since the 1970s. And why technology has shifted from empowering low-skilled workers (e.g. spinning looms, containerisation, stuff affiliated with the Industrial Revolution) to empowering high-skilled workers (e.g. coding, quantum computers, financial modelling).

Focussing purely on labour supply and labour demand ignores the endogenous element of technology supply and technology demand. The more skilled labour there is, the stronger the bias will be on the production of skilled labour technology. Technology is a big misnomer here, it actually refers to Total Factor Productivity (TFP) which encompasses everything from industrial organisation, to education, to physical technology, to cultural attitudes.

Consequently, even if the same technology can be well diffused throughout the world (which it can't), then the effects of having more skilled labour depend on the flexibility of each individual economy, and any exogenous change in the proportion of high-skilled labour. For example, India is well known to suffer from systemic sclerosis, its organisations are incentivised to adopt labour-intensive processes because of the sheer amount of excess non-skilled labour. In contrast, places like China have just seen massive high-skilled labour booms resulting from exogenous (i.e. external to the model) education policies that are having dividends now as masses of STEM grads hit the labour market. Chinese firms are hence incentivised to adopt high-tech production methods, and that spurs demand for high tech labour which boosts wages.

It's also possible to think of the world as one gigantic economy (i.e. globalisation), in which case the result is similar. Global demand for high-skilled labour is increasing, as is supply.

659,AutoModerator,removecomment,2019-07-01 08:21:55,t1_esgvod9,"Absolutely not. In fact there's an entire model called Directed Technical Change (Acemoglu 1995) which is dedicated to explaining why both wages and supply of high skilled labour have been increasing in developed countries since the 1970s. And why technology has shifted from empowering low-skilled workers (e.g. spinning looms, containerisation, stuff affiliated with the Industrial Revolution) to empowering high-skilled workers (e.g. coding, quantum computers, financial modelling).

Focussing purely on labour supply and labour demand ignores the endogenous element of technology supply and technology demand. The more skilled labour there is, the stronger the bias will be on the production of skilled labour technology. Technology is a big misnomer here, it actually refers to Total Factor Productivity (TFP) which encompasses everything from industrial organisation, to education, to physical technology, to cultural attitudes.

Consequently, even if the same technology can be well diffused throughout the world (which it can't), then the effects of having more skilled labour depend on the flexibility of each individual economy, and any exogenous change in the proportion of high-skilled labour. For example, India is well known to suffer from systemic sclerosis, its organisations are incentivised to adopt labour-intensive processes because of the sheer amount of excess non-skilled labour. In contrast, places like China have just seen massive high-skilled labour booms resulting from exogenous (i.e. external to the model) education policies that are having dividends now as masses of STEM grads hit the labour market. Chinese firms are hence incentivised to adopt high-tech production methods, and that spurs demand for high tech labour which boosts wages.

It's also possible to think of the world as one gigantic economy (i.e. globalisation), in which case the result is similar. Global demand for high-skilled labour is increasing, as is supply. Over time, this should result in a clear divergence. In the extreme (i.e. if there are no rigidities or barriers whatsoever), then we should end up with a highly unequal world consisting of clusters of rich high-skilled regions and poor low-skilled regions. Each region is incentivised to prioritise technology growth in their own individual areas of advantage, but as a whole, the world is incentivised to produce high-skilled technology, so software engineers just become increasingly more well-paid."

The slope of the supply curve is typically positive because of the positive relationship between price and quantity of supply. When the price of a commodity increases, suppliers/sellers/producers have more incentive to ""supply"" more to the market. 

In relation to the demand curve, which has a negative slope due to the inverse relationship between the price and quantity demanded. 

Let's use hotdogs as an example. Think of the sale price of hotdogs. If the value of hotdogs were at 0, how much would you produce as a supplier? Probably none right? Because there is no profit to be made. What if the value of hotdogs was $50 each? Would you try to produce as much as possible? How much less would you produce if the value of hotdogs were $5? This relationship between how much you're willing to produce based on price is the supply curve.
*I use value and selling price interchangeably

The opposite is true of demand. If the price of hotdogs was 0, there would be unlimited demand. If the price was $50, the demand would probably not exist due to the existence of substitutes. But let's say there aren't any substitutes. What quantity of hotdogs are people willing to buy at $50 each? How about $25 each? 

Now, where the 2 curves intersect is commonly called the market equilibrium or equilibrium price. A point or minute range of prices where demand meets supply. Sellers sell X quantity at Y price and Buyers buy at X quantity at Y price. As a result, there should be less instances of shortages and surpluses.

It gets more complicated from here when you move into discussion about shprtage, surplus, elasticity, etc.

687,Serialk,approvecomment,2019-06-30 22:19:23,t1_esc540c,"This is a finance question not an economic one.  Beyond finance it is a very specific section of finance, investing.  First of all we have to define ""value investing"".  Most people define value investing as an investment style that specifically targets assets that will generate NPV of cash flow in excess of its current value.  Value investors don't just by regular equities, though that seems to be what you are implying.    The main idea behind value investing is fundamental analysis, it is the underlying cash flow that determines value.  Value investors consider speculation to be purchasing an asset that has no cash flow (Gold, raw Land), or NPV of cash flow below current value (BYND probably) in the hopes that there will be a ""bigger fool"" that will buy the asset.  

&#x200B;

Now to address a few other things in your post that might demonstrate a lack of understanding in these things.  1. Buyouts are not rare, like at all.  Since I started investing in 1997, the number of listed companies has decreased by more than 50%, primarily due to consolidation.  I have personally invested in dozens of companies and worked for a few that were bought out. 2. A value investor should never be buying a company that has a better chance of bankruptcy than buyout, unless the tangible liquidation value is greater current asset price.  That is the point of understanding the cash flows and asset that underly the investment.  3. Dividends are not the only way to return cash to shareholders, and if a business can reinvest capital at a higher rate than individuals can deploy the capital, due to taxation of dividends, it is likely in the shareholder's interest for the company to reinvest cash flow in business growth.  Share buy backs.  

&#x200B;

Imagine two scenarios 1. you invest $10,000 in gold.  The only way you can make a profit is to sell your gold for more than the $10K.  2. You put $10K into 10% of your buddy's widget company.  You could possibly make your money back from the cash flow of the business, from the sale of the assets of the business, the whole buisness getting bought by someone else, or selling your specific shares to someone else.    The other big difference is you can look at how much cash flow your 10% of the business is, how likely it is to grow, ROA, ROE, ROIC, etc."

I’ll try to maybe help out with some things you’re stuck on, but I might just be going over parts you already understand.

The basic idea is, it’s a measurement of price and quantity and their relationship, just from the supply side instead of the demand side. It’s important to think about it from the producer’s perspective. One of my issues at first was thinking about it from a demand/buyer side. If people want more of your product(demand), you can react by increasing your quantity or increasing your price (or the opposite of demand goes down).

There are different ways the supply curve reacts to things, but always think about it from you’re making the product. If you produce pizza and a study comes out that pizza cures cancer, the demand will go up for pizza. So, how can you respond as a pizza maker if people want more pizza? How can you respond if a study came out that said pizza leads to cancer? Think about what you can do as a pizza maker if half the tomato crop died for the year? Or maybe if tomato producers found a great, all natural pesticide that increased tomatoes?

The opposite is true of demand. If the price of hotdogs was 0, there would be unlimited demand. If the price was $50, the demand would probably not exist due to the existence of substitutes. But let's say there aren't any substitutes. What quantity of hotdogs are people willing to buy at $50 each? How about $25 each? 

Now, where the 2 curves intersect is commonly called the market equilibrium or equilibrium price. A point or minute range of prices where demand meets supply. Sellers sell X quantity at Y price and Buyers buy at X quantity at Y price. As a result, there should be less instances of shortages and surpluses.

It gets more complicated from here when you move into discussion about shprtage, surplus, elasticity, etc.

Lmao nevermind. Wrong curve haha. Top comment explained it well."

It’s a pretty big subject so it’s hard to describe the entire supply curve in a quick reply. The supply curve is generally more difficult to understand than the demand curve, so don’t worry about not getting it. 

I’ll try to maybe help out with some things you’re stuck on, but I might just be going over parts you already understand.

The basic idea is, it’s a measurement of price and quantity and their relationship, just from the supply side instead of the demand side. It’s important to think about it from the producer’s perspective. One of my issues at first was thinking about it from a demand/buyer side. If people want more of your product(demand), you can react by increasing your quantity or increasing your price (or the opposite of demand goes down).

There are different ways the supply curve reacts to things, but always think about it from you’re making the product. If you produce pizza and a study comes out that pizza cures cancer, the demand will go up for pizza. So, how can you respond as a pizza maker if people want more pizza? How can you respond if a study came out that said pizza leads to cancer? Think about what you can do as a pizza maker if half the tomato crop died for the year? Or maybe if tomato producers found a great, all natural pesticide that increased tomatoes?

Hopefully this helps a bit. If there’s something specific you’re stuck on I’m sure we can help out"

There has been much more PR done lately by mining companies reaching out to show the public what they have going on that may have been unknown by the public/communities. 

For the reports, If it is a mine or company that does business with a mine (a contractor), use MSHAs website

[www.msha.gov](www.msha.gov) 

You will find links to search for the various reports you are looking for, and the search functionality is pretty straightforward.

I will say though as someone with significant experience in this department, what MSHA reports is definitely not the best way to look at how these places are doing safety wise. As an  enforcement agency, they do most anything they can do to justify their existence by making things sound worse then they are. 

For example, your search on the MSHA website will yield all violations the company received in a certain time period which will include the law that was violated and the cost of the citation, but they will not provide you the actual body of the citation (the details of who/what/where/why) unless you file for a FOIA request. Why this is important is that if you actually have read some of these citations (even the $thousand ones) you would be surprised what they are actually writing citations on and calling “significant” safety violations, and getting away with."

720,AutoModerator,removecomment,2019-06-30 11:47:31,t1_esee8pr,"Capitalism is unique in that it has these three tendencies working as one (according to the Marxist David Harvey):

1. In order to develop society with greater access to a wider range of goods and services, the economy must trend towards a positive growth rate. If total value in a capitalist political economy stagnates, prices go up and access to goods and services becomes more difficult. Economies are often measured in GDP, the percent rate of increase in gross domestic product, not net worth.

2. Value is added to the total system through a mode of production in which labor that produces more value than the total cost of production is transformed into a surplus value. Thus, there is always a gap between what labor gets (wages) and what it creates. Although profit can be produced by many means, value can be added to the total economic system only through labor (and natural resources, depending on your definition of an economy).  This mode of production requires a bunch of laws and therefore institutions that uphold private property rights.

3. In order to make the production process more efficient, there tends to be a reliance on increasing technological innovation. In higher education, we like to replace faculty with online courses (such as a university’s plan to work with 2U) and replace administrative tasks with automated software. This tendency can also be observed in the supply chain for the required tools of higher education; the production of computers, food, lab equipment, and facilities increasingly relies on automated procedures and mechanical processes.

Many economic epochs had one or two of those things, but not all three."

Then submitting the finishes document and with any other supplements they require. After this it goes to the editor and can be desk rejected, after this if it  is not desk rejected it goes to referees. The referees will read the paper over, make comments and decide to accept, reject, or request a revise and resubmit. If I recall the final call is the editor. Accepted and rejected is fairly obvious, The revise and resubmit means they want you to add or make changes based on questions and concerns of the referees.

First of all we have to define ""value investing"".  Most people define value investing as an investment style that specifically targets assets that will generate NPV of cash flow in excess of its current value.  Value investors don't just by regular equities, though that seems to be what you are implying.    The main idea behind value investing is fundamental analysis, it is the underlying cash flow that determines value.  Value investors consider speculation to be purchasing an asset that has no cash flow (Gold, raw Land), or NPV of cash flow below current value (BYND probably) in the hopes that there will be a ""bigger fool"" that will buy the asset.  

&#x200B;

Now to address a few other things in your post that might demonstrate a lack of understanding in these things.  1. Buyouts are not rare, like at all.  Since I started investing in 1997, the number of listed companies has decreased by more than 50%, primarily due to consolidation.  I have personally invested in dozens of companies and worked for a few that were bought out. 2. A value investor should never be buying a company that has a better chance of bankruptcy than buyout, unless the tangible liquidation value is greater current asset price.  That is the point of understanding the cash flows and asset that underly the investment.  3. Dividends are not the only way to return cash to shareholders, and if a business can reinvest capital at a higher rate than individuals can deploy the capital, due to taxation of dividends, it is likely in the shareholder's interest for the company to reinvest cash flow in business growth.  Share buy backs.  

&#x200B;

Imagine two scenarios 1. you invest $10,000 in gold.  The only way you can make a profit is to sell your gold for more than the $10K.  2. You put $10K into 10% of your buddy's widget company.  You could possibly make your money back from the cash flow of the business, from the sale of the assets of the business, the whole buisness getting bought by someone else, or selling your specific shares to someone else.    The other big difference is you can look at how much cash flow your 10% of the business is, how likely it is to grow, ROA, ROE, ROIC, etc."

UBI gets rid of this perverse incentive by paying you a fixed stipend regardless of your employment status. Even some free-market economists have proposed a form of UBI. Look at Milton Friedman's [negative income tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_income_tax).

A tax cut by definition only affects those that are paying taxes. This is not necessarily a bad thing, as people and corporations who pay taxes are productive members of society. When taxes are cut people have more disposable income. People either save this disposable income or spend it. When they spend it, it goes directly back into the economy as consumption. And because one person's spending is another person's income a chain reaction occurs that raises everyone's income. This is called the [multiplier effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplier_(economics)). When they save it get injected back into the economy in the form of investment. Generally this goes out in the form of new loans, which lowers interest rates and/or makes funding available to projects that wouldn't have otherwise had it. Or it can go into capital investment like purchasing stock. High stock prices provide a return on investment for shareholders which they can either spend or save. In addition, the shareholder returns attract new competitors and provide a funding source for company acquisitions. Acquisitions are good for innovation because they provide a funding source (exit) for startups.

The argument of which one is better is not an easy one to answer. Similar arguments to this one pop up in policy debate all the time. We call this debate [supply side](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply-side_economics) and [demand side](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand-side_economics) economics. Instead of giving you my view, let me show you how you would evaluate what questions you need to ask to determine which policy has more merit. The first thing we need to do is list all the potential consequences of both actions (good or bad) and then later on assign a weight to it.

**UBI:**

* Removes welfare trap (+)
* Helps low income families, reducing [externalities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality) like crime (+)
* Would likely raise inflation (-)
* Reduces administrative burden of social programs (+)

**Tax cuts**

* Reduces [deadweight loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excess_burden_of_taxation) (+)
* Results in more investment (+)
* Result in more consumption (+)
* Would likely raise inflation (-)
* Lowers government revenues (-)

UBI: Alright, so now we need to figure out the tangible benefit of removing the welfare trap, lowering externalities and the reduced admin burden and see if that outweighs the cost of inflation. Since more people are adding value in the economy, people are removed from low-value admin, and less crime is being committed, any potential inflation should be countered from the increased output through this policy. Its important that we did this, because a lot of Government spending is inflationary. Its inflationary when the benefit to society is less than the cost of implementing the policy and has a real negative multiplier. See [broken window fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_broken_window).

Tax cuts: alright, so does the improvement in projects funded, increased investment and increased consumption make up for the potentially higher inflation and lost government revenues? Well since more output is being produced by new projects, more projects are being funded with lending and IPOs, and stock prices are going up this should counteract the inflationary forces. Now we have to determine was the money better off in the hands of the government or the hands of the people. Generally the money is better spent in the hands of the people, because it is easier for people to find value-added projects in millions of small microcosms than for the central government to manage changes in these small communities. However, infrastructure investments are also essential to the strength of the economy. To solve this last question we need to study the effectiveness of 1 dollar of government spending vs. 1 dollar of private sector spending and determine which spending has the higher economic output. Once we solve this question then we will have a factual basis to form our opinions.

It should be noted, you could probably have some combination of both tax cuts and UBI to maximize efficiency. It doesn't have to be one or the other. This process is also iterative. I may have forgotten an effect, made an assumption, or maybe the variables change or are not linear ie: [laffer curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laffer_curve). This is not a static model, which is why we need to test our hypothesis through regression in multiple markets over multiple time periods to become confident in the answers. This is why you shouldn't take one economic study too seriously if you see them in the news. There are many variables to control for, and its impossible for one study to prove an economic relationship."

Think of the freedom dividend as the never ending stimulus package. In my opinion, you don't really need QE because that much more money will end up circulating in the economy(3.2T was the number if I remember correctly). Understand that we aren't increasing money supply with the FD. We are merely redistributing it hence making money flow. Think of it this way, when we go into a recession, people tend to stop spending... stopping the flow of money. If we redistribute cash into people's pockets, they will begin to spend again... hence restarting the flow of money. Why buy back securities when you can directly ~~inject~~ redistribute cash into the pockets of those that will most certainly put that cash towards their basic needs.

In regards to when we hit a recession, based on Keynesian economics, AD is low during a recession. All you need to do is boost it back up with either Gov or Consumer spending. Austere policy during a recession will only worsen the recession due to continuous contraction.

And taking a final look at the AD equation, G is the largest term. Will something like the freedom dividend increase G more or will QE increase it more? Also think about where the cash is going in the case of QE versus FD. And how will that cash be used?

The only result of raising the price would be that the customer will have to pay more money -- which even if the customer does pay, doesn't make any more profit for the seller, or the customer can choose to buy from different place -- which would make the price hike counterproductive. How are manufacturers/companies able to subvert their tax liabilities by raises prices?

It absolutely does not matter *at all* who pays the tax on paper. Tax incidence is determined by the elasticity of supply/demand.

Let's take tobacco for example.

Unsurprisingly, the elasticity for tobacco demand is very low. It's simple, tobacco is super addictive. The *entire* tax burden of tobacco falls on consumers. And not only that, they even pay more *beyond* the tax burden. In simpler terms, because people who buy tobacco want it so badly, they accept any price increase, and the tax burden lies entirely on them, no matter who pays it on paper.

Of course, that's an extreme scenario, but for many goods, the elasticity of supply/demand is such that the tax burden is shifted to consumers to at least some degree. So yes, the company might lose a bit of profit, but prices still go up, because the tax burden lies on both the company *and* the consumer."

If you're looking to go to school to reach a specific checkpoint, you should go to a technical college that grants a certification upon graduation.  When you graduate from college, you still have to deal with entry level jobs requiring 3-5 years experience to get hired.    Having a certification, supercedes that requirement and directly qualifies you for specific jobs.        

Think about the difference between a bachelors in Business and an MBA.  The answer should be clear.   That said, you could get by with a Business Economics major if you're focused on starting up your own business or being an entrepreneur.


Sorry, forgot to answer your questions.  Yes, an economics degree is one of a few degrees that secures higher paying jobs on average.  Can't promise a specific number for you though ANDDDD  an economics degree doesn't teach you how to secure a job anyway.  Just because you COULD make that money doesn't mean that you're guaranteed to make it.       

And Economics majors being among the most unemployed is sorta tied to the fact that... there aren't really jobs specifically tailored for economists.  Economics is a very, surprisingly complicated field.  A LOT of people have opinions about the economy, but don't really understand that nature of the beast in the first place and, on top of that, people don't necessarily take the advice of economists.  Those jobs are delegated to finance and accountants.   Add to that that we live in a short-term, supply-side disasterole (disaster + casserole) economy where no one is thinking about the mid or the long term, and you have a labor market that has little place for economics majors.   Our options are to either become professors, join a think-tank, enter the business world and settle for basic bitch, inefficient, bottom-line thought on how to accumulate wealth or find a job in a different field.       

Economics is a very hard soft science.  We have graphs and statistical models that show how things should be, but the problem is that the models are based on people making the correct actions and approaching issues logically or with virtue.  There's always an excuse to pay people less, but the excuses/reasons for paying people more are much more sparse.  Logically, if people can pay their bills and not be so fucking stressed out from day to day, they could provide more tax revenue, they could use their disposable income they have to boost profits for businesses and shit, they could pay their bills and no have the company miss out on their earnings projections.   ... But because the general public is so mindless about economics, they only see the first step of having to pay money and they think that that's the only thing that happens... and that it's horrific.   They've bought into the old wive's tales that they've heard about money.  ""Well shit, if they have to pay people more, that'll make the business suffer and go over and then EVERYONE WILL BE FUCKED!  So let's do nothing!""  A blind man could see that we've done our best to exterminate the middle class, but people don't understand that a healthy, vibrant economy has a healthy middle class....  because fuck, why doesn't it make sense to have >50% of your population solvent and comfortable.       

The reason you should pursue more than just a bachelor's, if you love Economics, is because people actually don't understand the logic behind what I just said.  Like, I've watched people's eyes glaze over as I start showing them the actual vast unexplored terrain of what you actually do with fucking money and what it's supposed to do, because they either didn't realize that there's more to economics than ""money in, money out"" or because it was like I presenting some completely alien object to them that disgusts them.       


Point is.  Very few people respect economists because they don't understand it.  The amount of those people that are in charge for building a business, let alone, hiring people is few and far between.    If you want to use your degree, don't settle for basic bullshit.  There are gonna be plenty of people with economics degrees.  Not many will have a Masters, let alone a PhD.      

Frankly, you need to ask yourself why you chose the major.  Is it because you want to devote your time to it?  Or is it simply because you want to understand the world better.  If it's the latter, your question is irrelevant.  If it's the form, the answer is no."

* Speak up and ask/answer questions in your classes. Professors are more likely to agree to research assistanceships if they know who you are, and the best way for that to happen is to participate during lectures as much as possible. Even if it's just asking clarifying questions for your own understanding, be an active participant in classes.
* Look at data and learn how to explore it. A lot of economics research is finding and manipulating data in a way that reveals information about it. Go and download datasets from any public data set (Bureau of Labour Statistics, ACS, IPUMS, OECD website, Statistics Canada, Eurostat, etc) and just start to play with it. Gain some experience with R or Stata and learn the basic functions of some of those libraries.
* Learn about your professors research. A lot of them are probably working on projects that you aren't hearing about in class, even if you aren't actively seeking to work with a particular professor, ask them about their research to at least learn what's possible and what you might find interesting.

I find that a lot of professors especially appreciate assistants with good programming skills, so learning some basic R (including how to use the dplyr and ggplot packages) and even a bit of Python could be helpful."

It really comes down to the fact that portfolio returns are formed by a (weighted) arithmetic mean while portfolio variance *also* depends on correlations between portfolio elements; you can see the standard *n*\-asset formulas [on the Modern portfolio theory wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory).

Let's imagine you have 2 assets (A and B) in your portfolio of $100, each representing a 50% or $50 weighting.  
Asset A has an expected return (time period doesn't matter as long as we're consistent) of 5%, and a standard deviation of 25%, while asset B has an expected return of 10%, and a standard deviation of 40%.  
The correlation coefficient between the two is 0.3.

With this, your portfolio expected return is (5% + 10%)/2 = 7.5%; makes sense - an average of two evenly weighted assets linearly interpolates their returns.  
But, your portfolio variance is (0.5\^2 \* 0.25\^2) + (0.5\^2 \* 0.4\^2) + (0.5 \* 0.5 \* 0.25 \* 0.4 \*  0.3) = 6.3%, which equates to a 25.1% standard deviation.

Pretty clear if we compare to asset A, we've increased returns by half with a negligible increase in risk - there are also many measures we can use to show improvements like this occurred, such as the [Sharpe ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharpe_ratio).

Note that this improvement hinges on the correlation coefficient - in general, the lower an asset's correlation to your existing portfolio the more effectively it will allow you to diversify (consider if our correlation was negative - the third term in our portfolio variance would be negative as well!). This is why you cannot diversify systematic risk - as your portfolio grows it becomes impossible to find *any* asset which will be uncorrelated with your portfolio, because all assets reflect some kind of underlying trend. To think about this, consider if you owned a piece of every single asset in all markets across the world; if a systematic shock hits like a violent alien invasion, your diversified portfolio will still suffer as every asset class and market is exposed - this is a 'limit' on finding uncorrelated stocks.

(Side note: this 'limit' is more significantly true in *theory* than in practice, as we do not have the true correlations between assets, only our best approximations from sample data. This is why diversification strategies will often be justified in logical as well as mathematical terms, because the example I used in this comment falls apart if our estimate of the correlation coefficient \[0.3\] is far from the true value.)"

If you're looking to go to school to reach a specific checkpoint, you should go to a technical college that grants a certification upon graduation.  When you graduate from college, you still have to deal with entry level jobs requiring 3-5 years experience to get hired.    Having a certification, supercedes that requirement and directly qualifies you for specific jobs.        

Think about the difference between a bachelors in Business and an MBA.  The answer should be clear.   That said, you could get by with a Business Economics major if you're focused on starting up your own business or being an entrepreneur.


Sorry, forgot to answer your questions.  Yes, an economics degree is one of a few degrees that secures higher paying jobs on average.  Can't promise a specific number for you though ANDDDD  an economics degree doesn't teach you how to secure a job anyway.  Just because you COULD make that money doesn't mean that you're guaranteed to make it.       

And Economics majors being among the most unemployed is sorta tied to the fact that... there aren't really jobs specifically tailored for economists.  Economics is a very, surprisingly complicated field.  A LOT of people have opinions about the economy, but don't really understand that nature of the beast in the first place and, on top of that, people don't necessarily take the advice of economists.  Those jobs are delegated to finance and accountants.   Add to that that we live in a short-term, supply-side disasterole (disaster + casserole) economy where no one is thinking about the mid or the long term, and you have a labor market that has little place for economics majors.   Our options are to either become professors, join a think-tank, enter the business world and settle for basic bitch, inefficient, bottom-line thought on how to accumulate wealth or find a job in a different field.       

Economics is a very hard soft science.  We have graphs and statistical models that show how things should be, but the problem is that the models are based on people making the correct actions and approaching issues logically or with virtue.  There's always an excuse to pay people less, but the excuses/reasons for paying people more are much more sparse.  Logically, if people can pay their bills and not be so fucking stressed out from day to day, they could provide more tax revenue, they could use their disposable income they have to boost profits for businesses and shit, they could pay their bills and no have the company miss out on their earnings projections.   ... But because the general public is so mindless about economics, they only see the first step of having to pay money and they think that that's the only thing that happens... and that it's horrific.   They've bought into the old wive's tales that they've heard about money.  ""Well shit, if they have to pay people more, that'll make the business suffer and go over and then EVERYONE WILL BE FUCKED!  So let's do nothing!""  A blind man could see that we've done our best to exterminate the middle class, but people don't understand that a healthy, vibrant economy has a healthy middle class....  because fuck, why doesn't it make sense to have >50% of your population solvent and comfortable.       

The reason you should pursue more than just a bachelor's, if you love Economics, is because people actually don't understand the logic behind what I just said.  Like, I've watched people's eyes glaze over as I start showing them the actual vast unexplored terrain of what you actually do with fucking money and what it's supposed to do, because they either didn't realize that there's more to economics than ""money in, money out"" or because it was like I presenting some completely alien object to them that disgusts them.       


Point is.  Very few people respect economists because they don't understand it.  The amount of those people that are in charge for building a business, let alone, hiring people is few and far between.    If you want to use your degree, don't settle for basic bullshit.  There are gonna be plenty of people with economics degrees.  Not many will have a Masters, let alone a PhD.      

Frankly, you need to ask yourself why you chose the major.  Is it because you want to devote your time to it?  Or is it simply because you want to understand the world better.  If it's the latter, your question is irrelevant.  If it's the form, the answer is no."

According to [this link](https://motls.blogspot.com/2006/03/iq-in-different-fields.html) and [its source](http://web.archive.org/web/20070104093613/http://www.econphd.net/guide.htm), the average Econ PhD has an IQ of 128.0, which is 28/15 = 1.87 standard deviations above average, that is the top 3rd percentile of the population. Notice that this is very close to the IQs of physicists (130.0) and mathematicians (129.0), so economics is up there with the cognitively most challenging professions. Contrast PhDs in sociology (115.0) and business (116.0).

That is the average, though, so you can certainly get by with something less than that. Some personality traits play a role that is just as big as IQ, particularly high conscientiousness (efficient, organised). Low neuroticism (secure, confident) cannot hurt. Having a passion for the discipline is also no doubt a huge contributing factor.

> I would say I am slightly above average intelligence

Did you take a test? It is possible that you are underestimating yourself, particularly if you hang out with people who are already selected as more intelligent than average (fellow BBAs). Many online sources say that the IQ difference between someone with a Bachelor's and someone with a PhD is 10 points on average, so 0.67 standard deviations, so your average econ PhD is on average around the 3rd percentile of the general population by IQ, but on average around the 25th percentile of the average BBA. (EDIT: Did I say 'average'?)

So if you feel that you are smarter than your average BBA colleague, even if not by much, statistically speaking you should be smart enough to get a PhD in economics.

I couldn't find good data on the IQs of professors, sorry.

They kinda started with a parallel economic theory which led to the revolution, they were Marxists.

They believed the price of goods is determined by the labour that has to be put into them - which is just plain wrong - they built on false premises.

If you follow that path like Marx did you come to the conclusion that private ownership of means of production is always extracting surplus labour from employees - this is why they expropiated the means of production to the state and it was the state that dictated what, how, and how much should be produced. Economics based on marxist principles say it's that way that you produce more material wealth for everyone.

Of course, we have the figures now of what happens when businesses are expropiated, if memory servers right in Venezuela every industry expropiated saw its real output drop by 40 to 70% - This is partly because of the prices of goods are not determined by the labour put into them (this is just Marxist theory being wrong). Consensual contracts between employers and employees are beneficial for both parties (nobody is ripping off anyone else) - and because it turns out having other incentives than profit messes up production efficiency - capitalism benefits those that manage resources well by giving them more resources to manage, the hierarchies it creates are in a very large part based on ability."

* Oct. 24, 1963 2%

See how the numbers just stop growing so fast

Prior to the economic recession of the early 1990s, the Commonwealth of Virginia used a cost-sharing policy to determine appropriate tuition levels. To establish more equitable tuition practices among institutions, Virginia introduced a 70/30 policy in 1976. 

* Under this plan, E&G appropriations were based on the state providing 70% of the cost of education -- a budgetary estimate based on the instruction and related support costs per student — and students contributing the remaining 30%. The community-college policy was for costs to be 80% state- and 20% student-funded.

Due to the recession of the early 1990s, the 70/30 policy was abandoned because the Commonwealth could not maintain its level of general fund support. As a result, large tuition increases were authorized in order to assist in offsetting general fund budget reductions

Since 2002, Virginia’s public system of higher education has experienced a steady shift in how it is funded. 
Students and their families have taken on a larger share of the cost; measurements that track the state cost share of education and the total charge as a percentage of per-capita disposable income at Virginia institutions are higher than they ever have been.

* Virginia undergraduate students in 2018 will pay, on average, 55% of the cost of education, which is reflected as tuition and mandatory E&G fees. 
 * In 2017 it was 52% Student Share
* The state share will fall to 45% in 2018, which is 22 percentage points below the 67% outlined in the state’s cost-share policy
   * And below further the 70% share the state paid in 1970

1.Market Failures are notoriously difficult to identify, and even harder to quantify. Here's a lovely conversation between Eugene Fama and Richard Thaler:

[http://review.chicagobooth.edu/economics/2016/video/are-markets-efficient](http://review.chicagobooth.edu/economics/2016/video/are-markets-efficient)

You'll notice that, essentially, Fama argues that you can't even necessarily classify the 2008 bubble as a market failure.  For all we know, the true value simply decreased rapidly over a certain period of time. Similarly, you could argue that climate change costs have been properly internalized and/or the current response is the efficient response. Notice that Thaler only points out situations in which there is some empirical metric for the value of the asset in question. In these cases specifically, we can actually quantify the market failure.

&#x200B;

Essentially it's just really hard to disprove something that hasn't happened. You need a perfect world model which you know is empirically perfect, which gives a clearly defined and comparable overall utility curve.

&#x200B;

2. It's really hard to compare things to other historical things and in general any question with such broad scope is not constructive.

&#x200B;

Even if we could somehow calculate the costs of climate change and how much of that cost could have been offset by a different set of responses, statements like ""in history"" are not particularly meaningful because different periods of history are different. Was slavery a market failure? Was imperialism a market failure? Was the population concentration and subsequent collapse of cities in South America a market failure?Basically you need to define your question a lot more narrowly.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Consider redefining the question if you're interested in pertinent research. ""Is there research into market impacts of climate change?"" ""What is the economic effect of differing levels of climate change?"" etc."

It really comes down to the fact that portfolio returns are formed by a (weighted) arithmetic mean while portfolio variance *also* depends on correlations between portfolio elements; you can see the standard *n*\-asset formulas [on the Modern portfolio theory wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory).

Let's imagine you have 2 assets (A and B) in your portfolio of $100, each representing a 50% or $50 weighting.  
Asset A has an expected return (time period doesn't matter as long as we're consistent) of 5%, and a standard deviation of 25%, while asset B has an expected return of 10%, and a standard deviation of 40%.  
The correlation coefficient between the two is 0.3.

With this, your portfolio expected return is (5% + 10%)/2 = 7.5%; makes sense - an average of two evenly weighted assets linearly interpolates their returns.  
But, your portfolio variance is (0.5\^2 \* 0.25\^2) + (0.5\^2 \* 0.4\^2) + (0.5 \* 0.5 \* 0.25 \* 0.4 \*  0.3) = 6.3%, which equates to a 25.1% standard deviation.

Pretty clear if we compare to asset A, we've increased returns by half with a negligible increase in risk - there are also many measures we can use to show improvements like this occurred, such as the [Sharpe ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharpe_ratio).

Note that this improvement hinges on the correlation coefficient - in general, the lower an asset's correlation to your existing portfolio the more effectively it will allow you to diversify (consider if our correlation was negative - the third term in our portfolio variance would be negative as well!). This is why you cannot diversify systematic risk - as your portfolio grows it becomes impossible to find *any* asset which will be uncorrelated with your portfolio, because all assets reflect some kind of underlying trend. To think about this, consider if you owned a piece of every single asset in all markets across the world; if a systematic shock hits like a violent alien invasion, your diversified portfolio will still suffer as every asset class and market is exposed - this is a 'limit' on finding uncorrelated stocks.

(Side note: this 'limit' is more significantly true in *theory* than in practice, as we do not have the true correlations between assets, only our best approximations from sample data. This is why diversification strategies will often be justified in logical as well as mathematical terms, because the example I used in this comment falls apart if our estimate of the correlation coefficient \[0.3\] is far from the true value.)"

Even if it's just asking clarifying questions for your own understanding, be an active participant in classes.
* Look at data and learn how to explore it. A lot of economics research is finding and manipulating data in a way that reveals information about it. Go and download datasets from any public data set (Bureau of Labour Statistics, ACS, IPUMS, OECD website, Statistics Canada, Eurostat, etc) and just start to play with it. Gain some experience with R or Stata and learn the basic functions of some of those libraries.
* Learn about your professors research. A lot of them are probably working on projects that you aren't hearing about in class, even if you aren't actively seeking to work with a particular professor, ask them about their research to at least learn what's possible and what you might find interesting.

I find that a lot of professors especially appreciate assistants with good programming skills, so learning some basic R (including how to use the dplyr and ggplot packages) and even a bit of Python could be helpful."

According to [this link](https://motls.blogspot.com/2006/03/iq-in-different-fields.html) and [its source](http://web.archive.org/web/20070104093613/http://www.econphd.net/guide.htm), the average Econ PhD has an IQ of 128.0, which is 28/15 = 1.87 standard deviations above average, that is the top 3rd percentile of the population. Notice that this is very close to the IQs of physicists (130.0) and mathematicians (129.0), so economics is up there with the cognitively most challenging professions. Contrast PhDs in sociology (115.0) and business (116.0).

That is the average, though, so you can certainly get by with something less than that. Some personality traits play a role that is just as big as IQ, particularly high conscientiousness (efficient, organised). Low neuroticism (secure, confident) cannot hurt. Having a passion for the discipline is also no doubt a huge contributing factor.

> I would say I am slightly above average intelligence

Did you take a test? It is possible that you are underestimating yourself, particularly if you hang out with people who are already selected as more intelligent than average (fellow BBAs). Many online sources say that the IQ difference between someone with a Bachelor's and someone with a PhD is 10 points on average, so 0.67 standard deviations, so your average econ PhD is on average around the 3rd percentile of the general population by IQ, but on average around the 25th percentile of the average BBA. (EDIT: Did I say 'average'?)

So if you feel that you are smarter than your average BBA colleague, even if not by much, statistically speaking you should be smart enough to get a PhD in economics.



>  I would love to be a professor someday

I couldn't find good data on the IQs of professors, sorry.

921,AutoModerator,removecomment,2019-06-27 18:16:37,t1_es6xdtl,"Unfortunately, I do not believe this question is particularly answerable as posed. However, I can perhaps leave some useful information regardless.

&#x200B;

1.Market Failures are notoriously difficult to identify, and even harder to quantify. Here's a lovely conversation between Eugene Fama and Richard Thaler:

[http://review.chicagobooth.edu/economics/2016/video/are-markets-efficient](http://review.chicagobooth.edu/economics/2016/video/are-markets-efficient)

You'll notice that, essentially, Fama argues that you can't even necessarily classify the 2008 bubble as a market failure.  For all we know, the true value simply decreased rapidly over a certain period of time. Similarly, you could argue that climate change costs have been properly internalized and/or the current response is the efficient response. Notice that Thaler only points out situations in which there is some empirical metric for the value of the asset in question. In these cases specifically, we can actually quantify the market failure.

&#x200B;

Essentially it's just really hard to disprove something that hasn't happened. You need a perfect world model which you know is empirically perfect, which gives a clearly defined and comparable overall utility curve.

&#x200B;

2. It's really hard to compare things to other historical things and in general any question with such broad scope is not constructive.

&#x200B;

Even if we could somehow calculate the costs of climate change and how much of that cost could have been offset by a different set of responses, statements like ""in history"" are not particularly meaningful because different periods of history are different. Was slavery a market failure? Was imperialism a market failure? Was the population concentration and subsequent collapse of cities in South America a market failure?Basically you need to define your question a lot more narrowly.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Consider redefining the question if you're interested in pertinent research. ""Is there research into market impacts of climate change?"" ""What is the economic effect of differing levels of climate change?"" etc."

* Jan. 1, 1983 5%
* May 1, 1973 4%
* Oct. 24, 1963 2%

See how the numbers just stop growing so fast

Prior to the economic recession of the early 1990s, the Commonwealth of Virginia used a cost-sharing policy to determine appropriate tuition levels. To establish more equitable tuition practices among institutions, Virginia introduced a 70/30 policy in 1976. 

* Under this plan, E&G appropriations were based on the state providing 70% of the cost of education -- a budgetary estimate based on the instruction and related support costs per student — and students contributing the remaining 30%. The community-college policy was for costs to be 80% state- and 20% student-funded.

Due to the recession of the early 1990s, the 70/30 policy was abandoned because the Commonwealth could not maintain its level of general fund support. As a result, large tuition increases were authorized in order to assist in offsetting general fund budget reductions

Since 2002, Virginia’s public system of higher education has experienced a steady shift in how it is funded. 
Students and their families have taken on a larger share of the cost; measurements that track the state cost share of education and the total charge as a percentage of per-capita disposable income at Virginia institutions are higher than they ever have been.

* Virginia undergraduate students in 2018 will pay, on average, 55% of the cost of education, which is reflected as tuition and mandatory E&G fees. 
 * In 2017 it was 52% Student Share
* The state share will fall to 45% in 2018, which is 22 percentage points below the 67% outlined in the state’s cost-share policy
   * And below further the 70% share the state paid in 1970

I think a common fallacy when looking at these complex socio-political problems if focusing too heavily on one variable, when there are in face several important ones, which are also correlated with each other, making it even more difficult to figure out.

In the long-term culture of Japan and Korea, conglomerates dominate. Sister companies own shares in each other. Shareholder value is not a top concern. Taking care of employees as well as all of the companies in the family is more of a concern. ""Empire building"" is easy to do -- invest in a new business, get more employees, and no one will complain that the ROI is 4% (or whatever) If you need a software vendor, you'll look inside the conglomerate rather than outside, even though the outside company offers a better service at a better price. If one company is not profitable for a few years, it will be supported. No one is putting pressure on the CEO to be efficient. Japan and China both had a decade or more of zombie banks that were kept afloat with small capital injections rather than write off the bad loans and move on. ROE and overall market returns in Japan are lower than the US and UK, and this might be explained by the fact that shareholders in Japan cannot effectively put pressure on top management to make a profit. Dividends and share buybacks are lower. In some industries Japan and Korea have done better, and you can see that shareholders non-interference helped in those cases. 

Contrast this with the embrace of creative destruction in the American business world, where underperforming companies are allowed to go out of business. Tech startups have a huge failure rate, but they've given us some hugely successful companies that have transformed the economy. American or British shareholders will sometimes discourage companies from investing in projects with low ROI. They will cut jobs if there's not enough work to do. They will find the vendor or supplier with the best value for the money. In the S&L scandal and financial crisis in American banking were corrupt, but officials moved quickly to get the bad loans off the books and move on.

Dividends in US and UK companies are generally higher. Some argue this imposes financial discipline on the companies, discourages empire building, and most of all discourages total wastes of money such as parties and corporate jets. Companies that pay dividends have better returns than companies that don't, even when controlling for other variables such as industry, size, etc. In a competitive economy it's generally very hard to maintain high growth rates for a long time. There will be competition. Successful companies have an economic moat (see Graham & Dodd, Buffett, and other). Investing in R&D may or may not be necessary."

980,ecolonomist,approvecomment,2019-06-27 11:24:49,t1_es3pq72,"No singular consensus among economists about what policies to implement to boost economic growth, mainly because there’s no consensus about what actually increases growth in the long run. 
First, we have to be clear about what we mean when we talk about economic growth. If we just want to pump up economic growth in the short run, there are a number of ways to do that. But what we should be concerned about is the pace of long-run economic growth. And while economists still really aren’t sure about its source, they have a good idea about what won’t produce a higher growth rate. Furthermore, many economists once believed that increasing savings could permanently boost the pace of economic growth, measured as the increase in gross domestic product per person. However, adding more capital and labour will only temporarily boost growth, and the pace of growth in the long run will eventually go back to where it was before. What needs to be increased, then, is productivity.

Focusing on how ideas are created and then how those ideas are propagated through the economy are key for long-run growth. Spurring innovation can’t and won’t be the only solution to faltering growth. But it’ll certainly play a part. So we may not know the exact policies to implement right away to boost economic growth. But there is an understanding of the general areas to focus on or not focus on. There’s a ways to go, but we know the general path to walk on."
981,ecolonomist,approvecomment,2019-06-27 11:24:26,t1_es3j5a5,"As /u/BainCapitalist said, there’s an important difference between short run and long run growth.  Most people who ask this question, though, are more interested in long run growth.  This issue is hotly debated, but to my mind one of the most important things that a government can do is promote *regime certainty*.

The opposite of this is [regime/policy uncertainty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy_uncertainty).  The basic idea is that government establishes the rules of the game that everyone has to live by and acts as a sort of referee over economic activity.  If you want to have a game that has people actually playing the game, then you need to establish some agreed upon rules and keep them fairly consistent so that the players can develop long-term strategies around those rules.  But if the rules of the game are changing constantly, then nobody really wants to play the game. They’re then left with two options:

1) put forth minimal effort in things that they know are “safe.” In an economy, this is basically hoarding cash and is a large part of what we saw banks doing during/after the Great Recession.  With Congress and Obama constantly threatening new regulations on the financial sector, investment was much, MUCH riskier than it otherwise would have been and so banks decided to hold on to their reserves because cash is (almost) always safe.

2) play an entirely different game.  In an economy, this would be analogous to taking your efforts elsewhere and moving your company to a different country, where the rules are more stable.  This is harmful for domestic long term growth for, well, obvious reasons :)

I fall much more on the “institutions matter” side of things.  If you get the rules of the game right and leave them largely alone, people will be able to make plans that extend longer into the future, which means greater long-term growth.  If you start mucking with the rules in unpredictable ways, then people can’t really make plans that are far into the future and focus more on “getting now while the getting’s good.”

This also speaks to the role of government in an economy.  If the government wants to promote regime certainty, then it needs to act as an unbiased and fair referee.  But if instead the referee starts playing in the game and starts picking winners and losers, then you end up with a situation where the only people who succeed are the ones who are bffs with as many politicians as possible.  This doesn’t seem like a very fun game to play.

Randy Holcombe has an excellent new book called[“Political Capitalism”](https://www.amazon.com/Political-Capitalism-Maintained-Cambridge-Economics/dp/1108471773/ref=nodl_) that just recenty came out that’s really good at describing a lot of this.

I can only focus on macro because that's closer to my field. 

Basically any recent quantitative macro models (post 1970's) are characterized by the following.

1. Dynamic - GDP today depends on GDP yesterday. Or capital stock today depends on capital stock from the past period. The models need to display dynamics. 

2. Stochastic - There are random shocks added to the model that generates fluctuations of the series (GDP, investment, hours worked etc). Some of these shocks are technology shocks, preference shocks, monetary policy shocks etc.

3. General Equilibrium - In order to model and simulate macro models, one thing that differs from micro models is that we need to model both the supply and the demand side, so prices and quantities are both endogenous in the model. 

So these classes of models are called DSGE models. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_stochastic_general_equilibrium 

No matter what ""school of thought"" (which is a pointless concept btw) you may be in, 99% of academic research in quantitative macroeconomics use DSGE models to formulate and assert their ideas. 

All Central Banks use these types of models to conduct policy analysis. (They can ask what happens to X,Y,Z if we increase FFR?) 

Essentially, most DSGE models are solved using dynamic optimization tools taken from engineering and physics (I think?).  

So basically a macro model is nothing but a set of non linear differential (if continuous formulation) or difference (if discrete formulation) equations. 

Then we see how the variables that are defined in these equations evolve through time given an initial conditions. Good analogy may be so let's say we fire a rocket, can we say something about the rocket's trajectory? That's basically what the DSGE models would be describing. What happens if we conduct some type of monetary policy, can we say things about GDP, inflation's trajectories? 

Now finally tools. At the end of the day, these types of models cannot be solved by hand, so we have to use a computer to solve. There are numerous packages out there to help you. (Dynare, Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe's package, Sim's Gensys, Uhlig's package) 
These are just different types of ways that you can solve a DSGE model.

In terms of theoretical tools, you would need to at least understand undergraduate level of ordinary differential equations. Typically, the set of nonlinear equations are reformulated as a set of linear equations around a specific set of points called the steady state. This simplifies our numerical problem A LOT because then these are cast as something called a linear state space! 
https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/linear_models.html

No matter how complicated your model may be, at the end of the day, if you do things right, then your equations will boil down to a set of nonlinear equations which then you linearize and put into a linear state space form, which will then be used to simulate the model. 

If this stuff sounds interesting to you, then head over to QuantEcon (second link) and take a look at some of their lectures. 

Hope this answered your question somewhat. If it didn't make any sense, then never mind haha.

edit: Just a quick edit that this model, while popular, is not perfect by any means! There are numerous criticisms that DSGE models (some completely ignorant, some sensible). However, it's the best set of tools that we have to understand the macroeconomy which is a really fucking hard thing to do."

American or British shareholders will sometimes discourage companies from investing in projects with low ROI. They will cut jobs if there's not enough work to do. They will find the vendor or supplier with the best value for the money. In the S&L scandal and financial crisis in American banking were corrupt, but officials moved quickly to get the bad loans off the books and move on.

Dividends in US and UK companies are generally higher. Some argue this imposes financial discipline on the companies, discourages empire building, and most of all discourages total wastes of money such as parties and corporate jets. Companies that pay dividends have better returns than companies that don't, even when controlling for other variables such as industry, size, etc. In a competitive economy it's generally very hard to maintain high growth rates for a long time. There will be competition. Successful companies have an economic moat (see Graham & Dodd, Buffett, and other). Investing in R&D may or may not be necessary."
1003,AutoModerator,removecomment,2019-06-27 08:17:11,t1_es5qqnb,"Ah fuck. It's late and I can't sleep so I'll answer this. I'm gonna guess you are familiar with some of the math stuff I'm gonna be talking about. 

I can only focus on macro because that's closer to my field. 

Basically any recent quantitative macro models (post 1970's) are characterized by the following.

1. Dynamic - GDP today depends on GDP yesterday. Or capital stock today depends on capital stock from the past period. The models need to display dynamics. 

2. Stochastic - There are random shocks added to the model that generates fluctuations of the series (GDP, investment, hours worked etc). Some of these shocks are technology shocks, preference shocks, monetary policy shocks etc.

3. General Equilibrium - In order to model and simulate macro models, one thing that differs from micro models is that we need to model both the supply and the demand side, so prices and quantities are both endogenous in the model. 

So these classes of models are called DSGE models. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_stochastic_general_equilibrium 

No matter what ""school of thought"" (which is a pointless concept btw) you may be in, 99% of academic research in quantitative macroeconomics use DSGE models to formulate and assert their ideas. 

All Central Banks use these types of models to conduct policy analysis. (They can ask what happens to X,Y,Z if we increase FFR?) 

Essentially, most DSGE models are solved using dynamic optimization tools taken from engineering and physics (I think?).  

So basically a macro model is nothing but a set of non linear differential (if continuous formulation) or difference (if discrete formulation) equations. 

Then we see how the variables that are defined in these equations evolve through time given an initial conditions. Good analogy may be so let's say we fire a rocket, can we say something about the rocket's trajectory? That's basically what the DSGE models would be describing. What happens if we conduct some type of monetary policy, can we say things about GDP, inflation's trajectories? 

Now finally tools. At the end of the day, these types of models cannot be solved by hand, so we have to use a computer to solve. There are numerous packages out there to help you. (Dynare, Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe's package, Sim's Gensys, Uhlig's package) 
These are just different types of ways that you can solve a DSGE model.

In terms of theoretical tools, you would need to at least understand undergraduate level of ordinary differential equations. Typically, the set of nonlinear equations are reformulated as a set of linear equations around a specific set of points called the steady state. This simplifies our numerical problem A LOT because then these are cast as something called a linear state space! 
https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/linear_models.html

No matter how complicated your model may be, at the end of the day, if you do things right, then your equations will boil down to a set of nonlinear equations which then you linearize and put into a linear state space form, which will then be used to simulate the model. 

If this stuff sounds interesting to you, then head over to QuantEcon (second link) and take a look at some of their lectures. 

Hope this answered your question somewhat. If it didn't make any sense, then never mind haha.

edit: Just a quick edit that this model, while popular, is not perfect by any means! There are numerous criticisms that DSGE models (some completely ignorant, some sensible). However, it's the best set of tools that we have to understand the macroeconomy which is a really fucking hard thing to do."

You will find many examples of ill-advised policies that did not yield the desired results, exactly because politicians did not anticipate the incentives their policies introduced and how people would react to it.

One example I'm currently working on is capital regulation for banks. You might have heard that banks need to adhere to a minimum leverage ratio (=assets/equity). This is because a more levered bank (lower leverage ratio) will have less resources (equity) to absorb a shock before going into default. One of the problems with that is how monitoring of banks leverage has been implemented. In Europe, banks need to report their leverage ratio on the last day of the quarter. Now think about what would happen if people only needed to report their income earned during December instead of the full year. What would happen to output during December? The same is happening now in European money markets. At the last day of the quarter, banks ""window-dress"" their balance sheets by entering transactions that increase their leverage, and do how they please during the rest of the year. This has led to an almost collapse of Euro money markets, especially around the end of the year. We have seen interbank rates as low as -5.5% for a day, just to jump back to -0.5% the day after. This is purely due to how the ECB monitors the leverage ratio. Other countries ask for it every day and they don't have that problem.

However, just listing such policy failures could lead the reader to the conclusion that everything would be fine if we just carefully considered all the possible outcomes/incentives. So I will name a more theoretic issue that shows that this is not (reasonably) possible: The [""economic calculation problem""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_calculation_problem), sometimes dubbed the ""socialist calculation debate"". It is a criticism against central planning stating that the information necessary to optimally allocate resources are only (reasonably) obtainable through a market-based pricing system. It is one of the main reasons why central planning has failed so spectacularly at allocating resources efficiently, despite being aware of the problem and spending huge amounts of resources on it.

>[The Johnson administration’s higher education task force] came down on the side of direct aid to students, essentially endorsing a voucher system—the one that we have today—in which the federal government gives students a combination of loans and grants. Student loans became an entitlement, like Social Security, which students were free to spend at the school of their choice. …

>What could go wrong? As it turned out, a lot… The combination of open access to schools and open access to loans turned the higher education market into a version of the Wild West. Schools of all types, banks, nonprofit guarantee agencies and Wall Street investors competed for federal student-loan dollars. In particular, the system gave colleges an incentive to maximize the tuition they extracted from students and the federal taxpayer by boosting fees and enrollment, which meant relaxing admissions standards. The federal government didn’t want to put in place any academic criteria to prevent someone from getting aid. The idea emerged that anyone who wanted to go to college should be able to… The voucher system, combined with a lack of government oversight, created perverse incentives: Colleges could raise money quickly by admitting academically suspect students while suffering little or no consequences if their students dropped out and defaulted on loans. The market was suddenly flooded with cheap money, which led to a surge in the ranks of college-going students. Colleges responded to higher demand by raising prices, leading Congress to increase loan limits and grants."

You will find many examples of ill-advised policies that did not yield the desired results, exactly because politicians did not anticipate the incentives their policies introduced and how people would react to it.

One example I'm currently working on is capital regulation for banks. You might have heard that banks need to adhere to a minimum leverage ratio (=assets/equity). This is because a more levered bank (lower leverage ratio) will have less resources (equity) to absorb a shock before going into default. One of the problems with that is how monitoring of banks leverage has been implemented. In Europe, banks need to report their leverage ratio on the last day of the quarter. Now think about what would happen if people only needed to report their income earned during December instead of the full year. What would happen to output during December? The same is happening now in European money markets. At the last day of the quarter, banks ""window-dress"" their balance sheets by entering transactions that increase their leverage, and do how they please during the rest of the year. This has led to an almost collapse of Euro money markets, especially around the end of the year. We have seen interbank rates as low as -5.5% for a day, just to jump back to -0.5% the day after. This is purely due to how the ECB monitors the leverage ratio. Other countries ask for it every day and they don't have that problem.

However, just listing such policy failures could lead the reader to the conclusion that everything would be fine if we just carefully considered all the possible outcomes/incentives. So I will name a more theoretic issue that shows that this is not (reasonably) possible: The [""economic calculation problem""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_calculation_problem), sometimes dubbed the ""socialist calculation debate"". It is a criticism against central planning stating that the information necessary to optimally allocate resources are only (reasonably) obtainable through a market-based pricing system. It is one of the main reasons why central planning has failed so spectacularly at allocating resources efficiently, despite being aware of the problem and spending huge amounts of resources on it.

Is this what you have in mind?"
1048,AutoModerator,removecomment,2019-06-26 16:52:53,t1_es3pq72,"No singular consensus among economists about what policies to implement to boost economic growth, mainly because there’s no consensus about what actually increases growth in the long run. 
First, we have to be clear about what we mean when we talk about economic growth. If we just want to pump up economic growth in the short run, there are a number of ways to do that. But what we should be concerned about is the pace of long-run economic growth. And while economists still really aren’t sure about its source, they have a good idea about what won’t produce a higher growth rate. Furthermore, many economists once believed that increasing savings could permanently boost the pace of economic growth, measured as the increase in gross domestic product per person. However, adding more capital and labour will only temporarily boost growth, and the pace of growth in the long run will eventually go back to where it was before. What needs to be increased, then, is productivity.

Focusing on how ideas are created and then how those ideas are propagated through the economy are key for long-run growth. Spurring innovation can’t and won’t be the only solution to faltering growth. But it’ll certainly play a part. So we may not know the exact policies to implement right away to boost economic growth. But there is an understanding of the general areas to focus on or not focus on. There’s a ways to go, but we know the general path to walk on."

Most people who ask this question, though, are more interested in long run growth.  This issue is hotly debated, but to my mind one of the most important things that a government can do is promote *regime certainty*.

The opposite of this is [regime/policy uncertainty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy_uncertainty).  The basic idea is that government establishes the rules of the game that everyone has to live by and acts as a sort of referee over economic activity.  If you want to have a game that has people actually playing the game, then you need to establish some agreed upon rules and keep them fairly consistent so that the players can develop long-term strategies around those rules.  But if the rules of the game are changing constantly, then nobody really wants to play the game. They’re then left with two options:

1) put forth minimal effort in things that they know are “safe.” In an economy, this is basically hoarding cash and is a large part of what we saw banks doing during/after the Great Recession.  With Congress and Obama constantly threatening new regulations on the financial sector, investment was much, MUCH riskier than it otherwise would have been and so banks decided to hold on to their reserves because cash is (almost) always safe.

2) play an entirely different game.  In an economy, this would be analogous to taking your efforts elsewhere and moving your company to a different country, where the rules are more stable.  This is harmful for domestic long term growth for, well, obvious reasons :)

I fall much more on the “institutions matter” side of things.  If you get the rules of the game right and leave them largely alone, people will be able to make plans that extend longer into the future, which means greater long-term growth.  If you start mucking with the rules in unpredictable ways, then people can’t really make plans that are far into the future and focus more on “getting now while the getting’s good.”

This also speaks to the role of government in an economy.  If the government wants to promote regime certainty, then it needs to act as an unbiased and fair referee.  But if instead the referee starts playing in the game and starts picking winners and losers, then you end up with a situation where the only people who succeed are the ones who are bffs with as many politicians as possible.  This doesn’t seem like a very fun game to play.

Randy Holcombe has an excellent new book called[“Political Capitalism”](https://www.amazon.com/Political-Capitalism-Maintained-Cambridge-Economics/dp/1108471773/ref=nodl_) that just recenty came out that’s really good at describing a lot of this.

Basically, these markets do not function normally. There just isn't the necessary real competition that would lead to lower costs for consumers. This allows businesses to raise prices and enjoy higher profit margins with little or no loss of customers.

This is due to a number of factors. In healthcare, the market never functions normally, because we do not tend to shop for healthcare based on price. I mean, think of it this way; if you break your leg and come into the hospital, you don't ask to see their prices first and then say, naw I'll go somewhere else. You just want care. You don't shop for the right deal like you do with, say, a car.

On the education side, super cheap and easy to obtain tuition loans have allowed the price of education to skyrocket, because the cost of the education is significantly more disconnected from the consumer (the student).

On top of all that, the last 20 years have seen tremendous industry consolidation in basically every industry. And the rate of new business formation is at multi decade lows. This means less competition, which means rent seeking behavior and monopolistic power. 

Just name an industry and it is likely that 2-3 large corporations dominant that industry. I would argue this is also a significant source of our inequality and our political strife, but that's a whole other discussion."

The interest rate on that debt is typically a few percent higher than any collateralized debt, so they would be more likely to pay off the student loan debt before cars, houses, etc. 

If the government takes on that debt, then a large number of people will see an increase in purchasing power. Hundred of dollars per month are now available to put toward a new car, a mortgage, or even basic necessities that previously couldn’t be afforded. 

This increase in demand is likely to have a large impact on economic growth. The marginal propensity to consume of those individuals will likely be very high, compared to for example tax cuts for the highest earners. This will directly lead to increases in consumption. 

The debt load, of course, must be financed as well. The government will be able to finance that debt at much lower rates than the individuals, but a large and sudden increase to outstanding debt would occur. This would cause government borrowing costs to increase, and yields to increase, so asset prices would fall (fixed income, stocks, etc.). 

The fall in those asset prices would be offset somewhat by increased consumption and demand, but the net impact on stocks and bonds would probably be negative, with winners and losers. The government would not likely take on private student loan debt, even if public student loan debt were forgiven, so banks probably wouldn’t be adversely impacted from loss of revenue streams. The government currently makes income from these public student loans. This “tax” on student loan holders would be removed. Again, this benefit would go to individuals who probably have a high marginal propensity to consume. 

An educated prediction, therefore, would be a jump in treasury yields, a net drop stock valuations, a good jump in GDP, and further stress on government deficit, but very noticeable relief to a financially strained portion of the population. As those individuals get comfortable, over time, there would be much more money available for stocks, houses, and bonds, and those prices would stabilize (perhaps pretty quickly).

The largest collection of gold which is directly owned by individuals and institutions is at the Federal Reserve bank of New York. While Fort Knox holds ~20 times as much gold, the majority of it is outright owned by the Treasury, used to mint coins at the direction of congress, and only a small fraction is offset by liabilities to owners of gold certificates. It is not possible to exchange gold certificates for actual gold, and the Treasury's liability to redeem certificates for their face value (always legally set at $42.2222 per fine troy ounce) is not dependent upon their gold reserve. 

If it were revealed that Fort Knox were actually empty, anyone with a monetized derivative of that gold who wanted to do so would be able to convert it to dollars without difficulty. This illustrates a feature of fiat currency, which *every single* nation now uses.

The gold would suddenly disappear from the Treasury's balance sheet, but this gold is presently only valued at a book value of ~$11 Billion at the legally defined price, which is far less than the market price for gold. So, the federal government would suddenly consider itself ~$11 Billion poorer. Compare that to the current annual deficit of 1.1 Trillion, and it's less than a rounding error."

The interest rate on that debt is typically a few percent higher than any collateralized debt, so they would be more likely to pay off the student loan debt before cars, houses, etc. 

If the government takes on that debt, then a large number of people will see an increase in purchasing power. Hundred of dollars per month are now available to put toward a new car, a mortgage, or even basic necessities that previously couldn’t be afforded. 

This increase in demand is likely to have a large impact on economic growth. The marginal propensity to consume of those individuals will likely be very high, compared to for example tax cuts for the highest earners. This will directly lead to increases in consumption. 

The debt load, of course, must be financed as well. The government will be able to finance that debt at much lower rates than the individuals, but a large and sudden increase to outstanding debt would occur. This would cause government borrowing costs to increase, and yields to increase, so asset prices would fall (fixed income, stocks, etc.). 

The fall in those asset prices would be offset somewhat by increased consumption and demand, but the net impact on stocks and bonds would probably be negative, with winners and losers. The government would not likely take on private student loan debt, even if public student loan debt were forgiven, so banks probably wouldn’t be adversely impacted from loss of revenue streams. The government currently makes income from these public student loans. This “tax” on student loan holders would be removed. Again, this benefit would go to individuals who probably have a high marginal propensity to consume. 

An educated prediction, therefore, would be a jump in treasury yields, a net drop stock valuations, a good jump in GDP, and further stress on government deficit, but very noticeable relief to a financially strained portion of the population. As those individuals get comfortable, over time, there would be much more money available for stocks, houses, and bonds, and those prices would stabilize (perhaps pretty quickly).

Also I will assume, that a large proportion rather than all loans will go to default.

Usually the majority of student loans is granted by government institutions. Losses from defaults will therefore be carried by govt entities and should not trigger a strong chain reaction in the private sector since the govt can always refund itself.

For loans handed out by the private sector, it depends on whether they are securitized or not. 

Securitized assets will lose in value and could potentially pose a threat to the financial system if there is a cluster risk from uneven distribution. This could trigger the Fed to jump in and backstop the market by buying the securitized instruments, just like they did in the housing crisis.

Non-securitized loans held by private banks will default against their equity, anything going above the amount they provisioned will incur unexpected losses. If there is a cluster risk from uneven distribution the Fed will most likely jump in to provide liquidity to single banks as lender of last resort, and the govt will bail out banks that run out of equity. They don’t have to do this, but I do not think anyone wants to replicate the Lehman experience.

Also the overall interest rates for student loans will increase to make up for the higher default rate."

The United States spends more per capita on health care than any other developed nation (Walker and Calderon, 2018). There’s little indication U.S. consumers are buying more health care compared to other countries. But the reasons behind the high prices comes back with varying answers. 

Some have pointed the finger at Hospital consolidation. Today, health care providers have more market power. Buoyed
by Insurers, they have less constraints on pricing than monopolists in other industries, creating significant inefficiencies for consumers (Havighurst & Richman, 2011).

But there's more than one way to monopolistic power. Another item to consider is input costs, which can differ for hospitals. The ability of hospitals to bargain and negotiate, say for medical devices, determine their markups because the input costs can have a wide-range of variation. In Grennan 2013, the author studied the medical device market for medical stents and found that the hospital’s ability to negotiate via differentiating horizontal markets allows them to profit from the lower costs. Therefore, the final cost for a service can then be broken down as the price to recover the cost it takes to deliver the service, plus a markup for said service.

Hospitals aren't the only ones in this game, however. There's also Third-Party Administrators, who handle claims processing and maintain the network of providers via contracts. Bajari et al. (2010) found that the majority of hospital contracts rely on a percent of charges structure. One reason why this matters is that is that the patient is paying the allowed amount determined by the contract, in addition to a fee. High charges can create perverse incentives for TPAs, who rent networks out to employers funding their own insurance. Say a TPA has a fee as a percent of savings (often referred to as the discount off charges), there is an incentive for the TPA to contract with Hospitals with high charges.

Finally, there's insurers and insurer consolidation, which has been written about ad nauseum.

Basically, these markets do not function normally. There just isn't the necessary real competition that would lead to lower costs for consumers. This allows businesses to raise prices and enjoy higher profit margins with little or no loss of customers.

This is due to a number of factors. In healthcare, the market never functions normally, because we do not tend to shop for healthcare based on price. I mean, think of it this way; if you break your leg and come into the hospital, you don't ask to see their prices first and then say, naw I'll go somewhere else. You just want care. You don't shop for the right deal like you do with, say, a car.

On the education side, super cheap and easy to obtain tuition loans have allowed the price of education to skyrocket, because the cost of the education is significantly more disconnected from the consumer (the student).

On top of all that, the last 20 years have seen tremendous industry consolidation in basically every industry. And the rate of new business formation is at multi decade lows. This means less competition, which means rent seeking behavior and monopolistic power.

You have a pretty warped view of ""work"" if you think ""a completely workless society"" is even possible. As it is, no one in America is required to work. In fact, 37% of people of working age do not work. They don't all starve, and the vast majority are not homeless. And even the half million homeless people in America rarely starve. Moreover, lots of people like working. Sure, everyone complains about their job, and job satisfaction certainly correlates with compensation.

More and more simple tasks have been automated, so most people need more training to fill the more complex jobs of the 21st century economy. Problem is, college was never meant to be treated as an apprenticeship program... so a lot of these people aren't finding good jobs even with college. Moreover, young people are forced to delay starting families further and further until they finish extensive post-secondary education and achieve career stability.

Part of the reason the work doesn't pay well is automation. That is a central tenant of this whole idea.

I'll read the whole paper some other time, but in the conclusion it looks like the author's argument boils down to ""what happened in the past will happen in the future"" and ""humans will get paid to interface with machines."" Take note of this section:

>This reasoning suggests that many of the middle-skill jobs that persist in the future will combine routine technical tasks with the set of nonroutine tasks in which workers hold comparative advantage—interpersonal interaction, flexibility, adaptability and problem-solving. Medical support occupations are one leading example of this virtuous combination, but this example is not a singularity. This broad description also fits numerous skilled trade and repair occupations— plumbers, builders, electricians, HVAC installers, automotive technicians—marketing occupations, and even modern clerical occupations that provide coordination and decision-making functions rather than simply typing and filing. Indeed, even as some formerly middle-skill occupations are stripped of their routine technical tasks and arguably deskilled—for example the stockbroking occupation—other formerly high-end technical occupations are made accessible to workers with less esoteric technical mastery, for example, the nurse practitioner occupation that increasingly performs diagnosing and prescribing tasks in lieu of physicians. I expect that a significant stratum of middle-skill, noncollege jobs combining specific vocational skills with foundational  Polanyi’s Paradox and the Shape of Employment Growth 165 middle skills—literacy, numeracy, adaptability, problem-solving and common sense—will persist in coming decades.

Apparently the author didn't get the memo that automation is all the rage in medicine these days... Not to mention, medical education costs quite a bit of money. And I'm not just talking about an MD. NP school costs money too. So do training programs for phlebotomy, respiratory therapy, ultrasound techs, etc. Sure, it's still mostly worth it in the end, but again, the amount of extra training required for ""middle class"" jobs continues to grow.

I do agree to a point that machines can never truly replace humans in many capacities, but I think the author overestimates the extent to which the average person can be trained in ""literacy, numeracy, adaptability, problem-solving and common sense"" to be able to effectively compete with the growing power of machines and a global labor pool. There are already many who can't, and they make $7.25/hr despite working in the richest country in the history of the world."

Also I will assume, that a large proportion rather than all loans will go to default.

Usually the majority of student loans is granted by government institutions. Losses from defaults will therefore be carried by govt entities and should not trigger a strong chain reaction in the private sector since the govt can always refund itself.

For loans handed out by the private sector, it depends on whether they are securitized or not. 

Securitized assets will lose in value and could potentially pose a threat to the financial system if there is a cluster risk from uneven distribution. This could trigger the Fed to jump in and backstop the market by buying the securitized instruments, just like they did in the housing crisis.

Non-securitized loans held by private banks will default against their equity, anything going above the amount they provisioned will incur unexpected losses. If there is a cluster risk from uneven distribution the Fed will most likely jump in to provide liquidity to single banks as lender of last resort, and the govt will bail out banks that run out of equity. They don’t have to do this, but I do not think anyone wants to replicate the Lehman experience.

Also the overall interest rates for student loans will increase to make up for the higher default rate."

Also uncapped property taxes because they’re the hardest to hide from the government since they know your address and the land value 

A VAT ensures that everyone pays taxes.  Drug dealers prostitutes and bankers all pay 

But VAT are criticized as being regressive since paying 10% on a burger hurts way more for a poor person than a rich person 

That’s why you have things like uncapped property taxes and carbon taxes that pay into a universal basic income because $1,000 means a lot more to a poor person than a rich person 

Also by having uncapped and higher property taxes and eliminating writing off the mortgage, you dis incentivize what is currently happening where rich people consolidate in rich areas and beg borrow and steal to hold their property because their property tax rates are capped.

Another experiment I want to run is to flip the school funding so that the taxes from the richest neighborhoods fund the schools in the poorest districts 

Right now young parents are highly incentivized to buy property in good school districts which creates a cycle of rich kids getting better educations and earning potential than poor kids 

If it were the opposite then young middlenincome families might make the choice of investing in property in poor neighborhoods to take advantage of superior schools and everyone will win

First, understand that when people talk about 0% or negative rates, they are not talking about interest rates that you or I or any other consumer would pay. Central Banks (e.g. the Fed) are basically the Bankers' bank. E.g. Bank of America has accounts at the various Federal Reserve Branches. Deposits at these branches are called ""reserves"" in banker parlance. The Fed has certain ""[reserve requirements](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/reservereq.htm)"" that must be met at any given time. Currently, large banks like BoA are required to maintain reserves in excess of 10 percent of the total liabilities to *their own* deposits. E.g. right now Bank of America has close to $2 trillion in total liabilities against its $1.5 trillion in total deposits from the public and various institutions. Therefore, BoA's reserve requirement is \~$200 billion. I.e. Bank of America must maintain a balance of over $200 billion in total reserves across its various accounts at the Fed. When people talk about 0% or negative rates, they're talking about the interest that BoA and other banks receive from the Fed on their reserves. Right now, BoA receives positive interest. But what has happened is that BoA and other big banks have found it advantageous to hold reserves in excess of their official requirements. This has been happening for many years and was a source of severe consternation for the Fed, especially after the financial crisis. The Fed wanted the banks to lend out more money and stop hoarding all of their excess cash, but BoA et al. were afraid of what happened in 2007-2009 when too many banks overextended themselves and the markets crashed. Zero or negative interest rates on excess reserves is an attempt to solve this problem. Basically, the Fed would \*charge\* BoA interest on their excess reserves, which should theoretically incentivize banks to stop hoarding cash, lend more, and stimulate the economy.

Negative rates are a reality in Europe and Japan, [and the results have been lackluster](https://www.wsj.com/articles/negative-rates-designed-as-a-short-term-jolt-have-become-an-addiction-11558363559)."

&#x200B;

There are some details that differ from the above - for example in the US the rate usually refers to the overnight interbank lending rate (which is managed by the Fed via selling and buying of various instruments)  vs the Federal Discount Rate.

&#x200B;

The basic idea is that the central bank has an infinite supply of money but it needs to manage how this money is absorbed by the economy so that (1) inflation doesn't get out of control or (2) money is so tight that investment is hampered and the economy doesn't reach its full potential (this can also be restated as: the people are not achieving their full productive potential because they are unemployed). Both objectives above pull the interest rate in opposite directions.

&#x200B;

An implication of zero interest rates is that it can't go any lower, since plain cash will now give a  higher return. Rather than submit to negative interest rates, banks might just decide to put all their money in vaults with guards if it's cheaper to do that. So if central banks feel that the rate needs to be lower (because people are still not investing as much as the economy needs), they have to come up with alternative methods to ease money supply.  The is what the Fed did with Quantitative Easing QE and QEII. The BoJ also tried small negative interest rates - although I haven't kept up with what's happened there."

This led to the Luddite movement, who went around smashing power looms in fears that machines would take their jobs.

And of course, machines did take their jobs, but they didn't just stop working as a result, they simply found different jobs. When technology advances in a way that increases the output of an industry with the same or lower levels of labour, two things happen: labour tends to become less necessary in that industry, and new industries are able to develop because technology has made more basic/primary industries less labour intensive.

Consider that the number of farmers in North America has dwindled from once being a vast majority of the population to less than 2%. Food production is now so efficient that we need only a sliver of the total population working towards producing it when we used to need most of the population. At the same time, computer programming and IT specialists have grown from being literally *not even a thing* to being a massively growing sector of the economy. These jobs didn't exist 50 years ago and they were barely a thing 25 years ago, but now we can't imagine our world without them.

In short, technological advancement tends to make old jobs obsolete and create the possibility for new jobs as time goes on. People are somewhat biased in the short run when they lose their jobs in a dwindling industry because they're the ones who suffer from it. Of course, we can't make everyone who used to be an auto manufacturer a computer programmer, but we can at the very least help them to continue be productive members of society through social support and education programs, self-employment assistance and loans and a solid pension system."

The US economy isn't ""broken"" but it can certainly be improved:

##Economy

* More affordable housing through less rent control, less zoning laws, and increased supply of housing.

* An updated and expanded anti-trust sector to address market concentrations, particularly in the tech sector.

* Crack down on occupational licensing.

##Immigration

* More controlled immigration. Health care and education benefits should be granted, but other benefits should be contingent.

* The refugee system needs to be improved, somehow.

##Taxation and Welfare

* Taxes: Payroll and employment taxes should be collapsed into income taxes. Transition to consumption taxes, like VATs (while addressing their regressiveness). Capital investment should be written off against Corp taxes. Moderate inheritance taxes should be maintained or reinstated. Implement taxes on carbon and other negative externalizes. Congestion tax for traffic in cities. Land value tax to replace property taxes.

* Welfare: Mandated parental leave and childcare assistance. Universal Pre-K. Lifetime vocational education (like Singapore). Either raise the retirement age, or make pension access dependent on income. Expand EITCs; maybe implement a Negative Income Tax."

First, understand that when people talk about 0% or negative rates, they are not talking about interest rates that you or I or any other consumer would pay. Central Banks (e.g. the Fed) are basically the Bankers' bank. E.g. Bank of America has accounts at the various Federal Reserve Branches. Deposits at these branches are called ""reserves"" in banker parlance. The Fed has certain ""[reserve requirements](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/reservereq.htm)"" that must be met at any given time. Currently, large banks like BoA are required to maintain reserves in excess of 10 percent of the total liabilities to *their own* deposits. E.g. right now Bank of America has close to $2 trillion in total liabilities against its $1.5 trillion in total deposits from the public and various institutions. Therefore, BoA's reserve requirement is \~$200 billion. I.e. Bank of America must maintain a balance of over $200 billion in total reserves across its various accounts at the Fed. When people talk about 0% or negative rates, they're talking about the interest that BoA and other banks receive from the Fed on their reserves. Right now, BoA receives positive interest. But what has happened is that BoA and other big banks have found it advantageous to hold reserves in excess of their official requirements. This has been happening for many years and was a source of severe consternation for the Fed, especially after the financial crisis. The Fed wanted the banks to lend out more money and stop hoarding all of their excess cash, but BoA et al. were afraid of what happened in 2007-2009 when too many banks overextended themselves and the markets crashed. Zero or negative interest rates on excess reserves is an attempt to solve this problem. Basically, the Fed would \*charge\* BoA interest on their excess reserves, which should theoretically incentivize banks to stop hoarding cash, lend more, and stimulate the economy.

Negative rates are a reality in Europe and Japan, [and the results have been lackluster](https://www.wsj.com/articles/negative-rates-designed-as-a-short-term-jolt-have-become-an-addiction-11558363559)."

&#x200B;

There are some details that differ from the above - for example in the US the rate usually refers to the overnight interbank lending rate (which is managed by the Fed via selling and buying of various instruments)  vs the Federal Discount Rate.

&#x200B;

The basic idea is that the central bank has an infinite supply of money but it needs to manage how this money is absorbed by the economy so that (1) inflation doesn't get out of control or (2) money is so tight that investment is hampered and the economy doesn't reach its full potential (this can also be restated as: the people are not achieving their full productive potential because they are unemployed). Both objectives above pull the interest rate in opposite directions.

&#x200B;

An implication of zero interest rates is that it can't go any lower, since plain cash will now give a  higher return. Rather than submit to negative interest rates, banks might just decide to put all their money in vaults with guards if it's cheaper to do that. So if central banks feel that the rate needs to be lower (because people are still not investing as much as the economy needs), they have to come up with alternative methods to ease money supply.  The is what the Fed did with Quantitative Easing QE and QEII. The BoJ also tried small negative interest rates - although I haven't kept up with what's happened there."

[From least efficient to most efficient](https://www.ecn.ulaval.ca/~sgor/cit/arnold_oecd_2008/arnold_oecd_2008.pdf):

1. Corporate income tax
2. Personal income tax
3. Consumption tax 
4. Property tax
5. Pigouvian tax

The short explanation of why is that pigouvian taxes are supposed to correct for a market failure, and as such are efficient by definition. Property taxation is the second most efficient since it's taxing a fairly inelastic good, therefore limiting the distortionary effect. Consumption taxes are more efficient than income taxes since the distortion favors savings and investment, while taxing income reduces the labor supply and investment. Corporate taxes are the most inefficient since the effect is largest there. Finally, not mentioned above are user fees which are also efficient by their very nature if priced properly.  

There are variation within these, where a land-value tax is theoretically more efficient than a tax on the entire value of a property since land supply is practically perfectly inelastic. A value-added tax is more efficient than a cascading tax, as does not penalize products which have been transformed multiple times. 

While corporate income taxes are the most inefficient taxes, the optimal corporate tax rate isn't zero. Otherwise, you create an incentive to incorporate to obtain a limitless tax-deferment savings account. Additionally, corporations do benefit from some public and clubs goods (most notably, roads). Considering there are no user fees for many of these, asking corporations to chip in is arguably more efficient. 

Finally, while consumption taxes are optimal, they are usually regressive (since consumption takes an increasingly smaller percentage of one's income grows). As such, a personal income tax is desirable for redistribute purposes despite the associated cost on economic growth. Alternatively, you can go [the Scott Sumner road](https://www.themoneyillusion.com/a-consumption-tax-is-a-wealth-tax/) and transform your income tax into a consumption by making savings tax-deductible.

Overall, the optimal tax policy would contain these features:

1. Pigouvian taxes as necessary (e.g., carbon tax)
2. Land-value tax collecting the land's rent
3. User fees when applicable
4. High value-added tax 
5. Some amount of progressive income taxation
6. Non-zero corporate tax"

As /u/DangerouslyUnstable already noted, the ideal tax system depends almost entirely on what you want to do with it.  If, for example, you wanted to decrease the number of people smoking, you'd place an exorbitantly high tax on cigarettes and other tobacco products (note: there's really strong evidence that the demand for cigarettes is very inelastic, so the tax would have to be HUGE to really have any discernible effect on the incidence of smoking and there's other evidence out there that so-called ""sin taxes"" are actually highly regressive. I'll find links to some of those papers and post them below later).

But I'm going to assume that your question is ultimately, ""what would be an ideal tax code that raises enough money for government to do the things that it needs to do while also not distorting prices and people's efforts?""  This is a REALLY big question and is tough to answer.  For one, if we had an answer, presumably we'd be doing that!  So by asking this question, you're already telling me that you think that the current tax code is less-than-ideal.  This is something that I totally agree with.  Did you know that the US tax code itself is over 70,000 pages long?  (note: I should point out that there's dispute with this number, with some people saying that it's only 400 pages long.  Why the disparity?  Some people don't think you should count all the pages of definitions/instructions/etc. and should only look at ""the code.""  I don't think this is accurate. My wife and I are expecting our first child.  In order to understand how to report this on our taxes, we had to read something like 25 pages from the IRS website.  I think all 25 of those pages should count, which is how I get to 70,000+ pages.)

There are basically two competing visions for taxes:

1. Minimize distortions
2. Minimize ""social welfare losses""

In the first camp, the goal is to minimize the distortive effects of taxation.  Suppose I taxed people who wore t-shirts but didn't tax anyone who wore long sleeve shirts.  Predictably, people would stop wearing t-shirts and would switch to wearing long sleeves.  This would be distortive because the tax is directly causing people to alter their behavior.  Let's do a more realistic example: suppose I tax income unless it's used to pay for health insurance.  Predictably, people would want to take their compensation from work in ""health insurance"" and less of it in ""dollars.""  However, this only really applies to people who can actually afford to take some of their compensation as ""health care"" and not as ""dollars"" i.e., only the non-poor could afford to do this.  Actually, Steve Jobs serves as a great example of this, as he famously was only paid $1 per year as his salary from Apple.  I don't need to tell you that Apple wasn't only paying him a total of $1 per year; he took his compensation in other forms, presumably in black turtlenecks and momma-jeans, but I digress.  So even just taxing ""income"" can be distortive, depending on how you define ""income.""  It turns out that all people, when asked to pay for things or not, will try to not (who knew?)!  As the old saying goes, ""taxes are the price we pay for a civilized society, but the best tax is one that somebody else pays.""

If you wanted to minimize distortions, you'd need to find some sort of a tax that applies to everyone regardless of what they do.  To my mind, the only tax system that does this is referred to as a ""head tax.""  Basically, everyone pays the same number of dollars no matter what.  You just have to pay $X per year and then you're done.  No exemptions, no nothing.  This has the beauty of being incredibly simple to pay (if you've ever done your taxes, you know how arduous that process is) but it has the downside that it ends up hurting lower-income people more than it does higher income people.  $1,000 per year is very different for someone making $20,000 per year than it is for someone making $20 million per year.  This leads us to the other end of the spectrum...

Way back in the mid-to-late 1800s, some fiscal theorists reasoned that there was a diminishing marginal utility of dollars, i.e. that an additional $10,000 for people like Jeff Bezos is worth ""less"" utility than an additional $10,000 to people like me (and presumably, you, but if not, let me know if I'm wrong - I've got a Center at my university and we'd love to have some additional funds for student scholarships!).  So if you wanted to raise money for the government to do things, it would make sense to raise the money from people from whom it wouldn't be that big of a deal in terms of lost utility.  This is where you get notions of a progressive income tax.  The idea here is that as you make more money you end up paying a higher marginal rate of taxes on that higher income.

Now, I've presented the two opposing ends of a spectrum.  All tax codes around the world fall somewhere in between these two, some closer to the ""minimize distortions"" side and others closer to the ""minimize social welfare losses"" side.  This also totally ignores exemptions and deductions, but those are often targeted for certain things (e.g. a 529 plan in the US is used to fund college education for your children, 401ks are for retirement, etc. etc.).

1222,AutoModerator,removecomment,2019-06-24 23:10:29,t1_eryujep,"Oh man, finally a public finance question! I wrote my dissertation in this field -- finally I get to use it!  :)

As /u/DangerouslyUnstable already noted, the ideal tax system depends almost entirely on what you want to do with it.  If, for example, you wanted to decrease the number of people smoking, you'd place an exorbitantly high tax on cigarettes and other tobacco products (note: there's really strong evidence that the demand for cigarettes is very inelastic, so the tax would have to be HUGE to really have any discernible effect on the incidence of smoking and there's other evidence out there that so-called ""sin taxes"" are actually highly regressive. I'll find links to some of those papers and post them below later).

But I'm going to assume that your question is ultimately, ""what would be an ideal tax code that raises enough money for government to do the things that it needs to do while also not distorting prices and people's efforts?""  This is a REALLY big question and is tough to answer.  For one, if we had an answer, presumably we'd be doing that!  So by asking this question, you're already telling me that you think that the current tax code is less-than-ideal.  This is something that I totally agree with.  Did you know that the US tax code itself is over 70,000 pages long?  (note: I should point out that there's dispute with this number, with some people saying that it's only 400 pages long.  Why the disparity?  Some people don't think you should count all the pages of definitions/instructions/etc. and should only look at ""the code.""  I don't think this is accurate. My wife and I are expecting our first child.  In order to understand how to report this on our taxes, we had to read something like 25 pages from the IRS website.  I think all 25 of those pages should count, which is how I get to 70,000+ pages.)

There are basically two competing visions for taxes:

1. Minimize distortions
2. Minimize ""social welfare losses""

In the first camp, the goal is to minimize the distortive effects of taxation.  Suppose I taxed people who wore t-shirts but didn't tax anyone who wore long sleeve shirts.  Predictably, people would stop wearing t-shirts and would switch to wearing long sleeves.  This would be distortive because the tax is directly causing people to alter their behavior.  Let's do a more realistic example: suppose I tax income unless it's used to pay for health insurance.

The US economy isn't ""broken"" but it can certainly be improved:

##Economy

* More affordable housing through less rent control, less zoning laws, and increased supply of housing.

* An updated and expanded anti-trust sector to address market concentrations, particularly in the tech sector.

* Crack down on occupational licensing.

##Immigration

* More controlled immigration. Health care and education benefits should be granted, but other benefits should be contingent.

* The refugee system needs to be improved, somehow.

##Taxation and Welfare

* Taxes: Payroll and employment taxes should be collapsed into income taxes. Transition to consumption taxes, like VATs (while addressing their regressiveness). Capital investment should be written off against Corp taxes. Moderate inheritance taxes should be maintained or reinstated. Implement taxes on carbon and other negative externalizes. Congestion tax for traffic in cities. Land value tax to replace property taxes.

* Welfare: Mandated parental leave and childcare assistance. Universal Pre-K. Lifetime vocational education (like Singapore). Either raise the retirement age, or make pension access dependent on income. Expand EITCs; maybe implement a Negative Income Tax."
1231,AutoModerator,removecomment,2019-06-24 21:17:09,t1_eryl42x,"From a growth-maximization perspective, you want the most efficient taxation.

[From least efficient to most efficient](https://www.ecn.ulaval.ca/~sgor/cit/arnold_oecd_2008/arnold_oecd_2008.pdf):

1. Corporate income tax
2. Personal income tax
3. Consumption tax 
4. Property tax
5. Pigouvian tax

The short explanation of why is that pigouvian taxes are supposed to correct for a market failure, and as such are efficient by definition. Property taxation is the second most efficient since it's taxing a fairly inelastic good, therefore limiting the distortionary effect. Consumption taxes are more efficient than income taxes since the distortion favors savings and investment, while taxing income reduces the labor supply and investment. Corporate taxes are the most inefficient since the effect is largest there. Finally, not mentioned above are user fees which are also efficient by their very nature if priced properly.  

There are variation within these, where a land-value tax is theoretically more efficient than a tax on the entire value of a property since land supply is practically perfectly inelastic. A value-added tax is more efficient than a cascading tax, as does not penalize products which have been transformed multiple times. 

While corporate income taxes are the most inefficient taxes, the optimal corporate tax rate isn't zero. Otherwise, you create an incentive to incorporate to obtain a limitless tax-deferment savings account. Additionally, corporations do benefit from some public and clubs goods (most notably, roads). Considering there are no user fees for many of these, asking corporations to chip in is arguably more efficient. 

Finally, while consumption taxes are optimal, they are usually regressive (since consumption takes an increasingly smaller percentage of one's income grows). As such, a personal income tax is desirable for redistribute purposes despite the associated cost on economic growth. Alternatively, you can go [the Scott Sumner road](https://www.themoneyillusion.com/a-consumption-tax-is-a-wealth-tax/) and transform your income tax into a consumption by making savings tax-deductible.

Overall, the optimal tax policy would contain these features:

1. Pigouvian taxes as necessary (e.g., carbon tax)
2. Land-value tax collecting the land's rent
3. User fees when applicable
4. High value-added tax 
5. Some amount of progressive income taxation
6. Non-zero corporate tax"

Everyone with wealth and assets gets a break and the only hope poor people have is to pump out more babies and live in dense affordable housing (I.e. Ghettos) 

My two cents is that I think the only win win is a Value Added Tax combined with a Universal Basic Income 

Also uncapped property taxes because they’re the hardest to hide from the government since they know your address and the land value 

A VAT ensures that everyone pays taxes.  Drug dealers prostitutes and bankers all pay 

But VAT are criticized as being regressive since paying 10% on a burger hurts way more for a poor person than a rich person 

That’s why you have things like uncapped property taxes and carbon taxes that pay into a universal basic income because $1,000 means a lot more to a poor person than a rich person 

Also by having uncapped and higher property taxes and eliminating writing off the mortgage, you dis incentivize what is currently happening where rich people consolidate in rich areas and beg borrow and steal to hold their property because their property tax rates are capped.

Another experiment I want to run is to flip the school funding so that the taxes from the richest neighborhoods fund the schools in the poorest districts 

Right now young parents are highly incentivized to buy property in good school districts which creates a cycle of rich kids getting better educations and earning potential than poor kids 

If it were the opposite then young middlenincome families might make the choice of investing in property in poor neighborhoods to take advantage of superior schools and everyone will win

The key to why market centralization occurs is why equilibrium is a single Innovation Corp. with DUT plus rather than a litany of Corp.s each providing their own equally popular DUT plus. An obvious cause for this might be IC patenting certain features of DUT plus, which grants a temporary government-enforced monopoly.

&#x200B;

The case in which a patent isn't possible or after the patent expires, though, are network effects. A network effect occurs when the number of users of a service or product impacts its value to a new user. In the case of GitHub, I'd imagine that once a plurality of git users learned to use it, using GitHub for projects became more convenient due to widely available expertise and better interoperability with other projects on the platform. Network effects like this tend to result in the dominant adoption of a single (or a few) service or product.

&#x200B;

The case of Bitcoin, though, I think is a little different. Going off [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.08572.pdf), the Bitcoin mining industry exhibits economies of scale. Economic theory asserts that economies of scale or increasing returns to scale contradict the conditions necessary for perfect competition, and so they must be associated with an oligopoly or monopoly.

1263,AutoModerator,removecomment,2019-06-24 17:35:03,t1_ery0jm2,"I think there are a couple of things going on here. The key to why market centralization occurs is why equilibrium is a single Innovation Corp. with DUT plus rather than a litany of Corp.s each providing their own equally popular DUT plus. An obvious cause for this might be IC patenting certain features of DUT plus, which grants a temporary government-enforced monopoly.

&#x200B;

The case in which a patent isn't possible or after the patent expires, though, are network effects. A network effect occurs when the number of users of a service or product impacts its value to a new user. In the case of GitHub, I'd imagine that once a plurality of git users learned to use it, using GitHub for projects became more convenient due to widely available expertise and better interoperability with other projects on the platform. Network effects like this tend to result in the dominant adoption of a single (or a few) service or product.

&#x200B;

The case of Bitcoin, though, I think is a little different. Going off [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.08572.pdf), the Bitcoin mining industry exhibits economies of scale. Economic theory asserts that economies of scale or increasing returns to scale contradict the conditions necessary for perfect competition, and so they must be associated with an oligopoly or monopoly.

&#x200B;

If you're looking for what makes a market a non-oligopoly or monopoly, you should look into the conditions that result in [perfect competition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_competition) or [monopolistic competition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopolistic_competition). If a monopoly or oligopoly exists, then one or more of those conditions aren't met in the market."

1366,Serialk,approvecomment,2019-06-23 18:03:39,t1_erkhkap,"Very complicated question. The essential or ELI5 version is:

Global commodities are priced in US Dollars (USD) since the end of WW2.

The People's Republic of China (PRC) needs USD to trade with other countries around the globe.

The PRC has a USD shortage, therefore the PRC sells its US treasury holdings, which it acquired over the course of decades as a form of savings, for USD today, which it then exchanges for other things like soybean, copper, and oil.

In addition to this phenomena, the PRC maintains a 'peg' or government set exchange ratio between its currency and the US Dollar.

The PRC's currency is the 'renminbi.' There is a domestic, that is to say, used internally in China renminbi, and an international, or ""off-shore"" renminbi. It is a single currency, but trades at different exchange rates to the US Dollar.

For the PRC to maintain its peg to the US Dollar, the Chinese government must manipulate the natural market supply/demand of on-shore renminbi by selling and buying as required to meet their mandated price ratio.

This requires additional US Dollars, as in any exchange, or trade, there is both a buyer and a seller. One who is selling the renminbi and buying USD, and one who is buying renminbi and selling USD.

&#x200B;

>But whether the US pay the money to China, or to someone else, doesn't really matter, or does it?

It does and it doesn't. The US Federal Government borrowed savings by selling ""treasuries,"" or ""bonds,"" and must pay back its debt as prescribed by the obligation to the holder of the obligation, that is, whoever owns the debt.

Now if the debt of one government is held by a 'hostile' government elsewhere, you can presumably see a situation where the indebted government might decide it is advantageous to default on its debt. Of course this has other implications of trustworthiness in the future and other major historical consequences. The oft-cited historical example is the Weimar Republic following WW1 and the collapse of the German Empire, leading into WW2.

&#x200B;

>So why should China selling US t-bonds have any effect on the US economy?

In the immediate term, it makes no noticeable difference besides how a given bond may be trading on any given day. Over the course of decades, it will alter the macro form an economy takes, as competitive advantages among many varied and complex factors take shape, including the currency exchange ratio values as the result of flows of capital from savers to borrowers, or sellers and buyers, and the nature of the borrowing taking place: long-term capital investment or immediate consumption.

> Did deregulation cause the Great Depression?

Regulation didn't play a large part in causing the Great Depression. Contrary to popular belief, it wasn't the stock market crashed that caused the Great Depression but the reponse to the stock market crash. Under Hoover's presidency, the Government cut federal spending and increased taxes. This may seem like a good idea at first glance but when done on a national level it doesn't work. What happened is that economic growth slowed as individuals had less to spend and decreasing government spending killed government jobs. This caused a viscous cycle where businesses had poorer/less customers. This killed some businesses which increased unemployment and killed more businesses. Interestingly, Obama's response was the polar opposite to Hoover's response which is why the Great Recession didn't turn into another Great Depression.

In an imperfect labour market,for example- a labour market in which firms have monopsony power, this is not generally true. Note that monopsony refers to a market with a single buyer, but firms can have some degree monopsony \*power\* even if there is more than one buyer, for example if there are costs and risks to changing employer .   


There are strong reasons to think that labour markets are not perfect, although the exact character of these imperfections is open to debate. Under these conditions a minimum wage might actually lead to a result that better approximates what a hypothetical 'true' perfect market would deliver.   


Even in a perfect labour market, one's contribution to the firm one is working for might be quite different to the effects- good or bad- that one's work has on society. For example, if one is working in an industry with substantial positive or negative externalities.   


And even if income did equal contribution to society as a whole, there would be normative arguments about whether this was just. For example, some people might not have had the opportunity to develop the human capital needed to make a large contribution because of their disadvantaged background, or some people might simply not be very skilled, or face barriers due to severe disabilities- does that mean they 'deserve' to live in poverty? Many people, including myself, would say absolutely not.  


So if income doesn't necessarily equal economic contribution, how are we to determine what people's income ""should"" be? This is a question outside the scope of economic analysis, a question which belongs to political philosophy.

1468,AutoModerator,removecomment,2019-06-23 00:21:31,t1_ertpipw,"In a perfect & competitive market, the wage of worker would, to put it inexactly,, be determined by their contributions to the firm they are employed by.   


In an imperfect labour market,for example- a labour market in which firms have monopsony power, this is not generally true. Note that monopsony refers to a market with a single buyer, but firms can have some degree monopsony \*power\* even if there is more than one buyer, for example if there are costs and risks to changing employer .   


There are strong reasons to think that labour markets are not perfect, although the exact character of these imperfections is open to debate. Under these conditions a minimum wage might actually lead to a result that better approximates what a hypothetical 'true' perfect market would deliver.   


Even in a perfect labour market, one's contribution to the firm one is working for might be quite different to the effects- good or bad- that one's work has on society. For example, if one is working in an industry with substantial positive or negative externalities.   


And even if income did equal contribution to society as a whole, there would be normative arguments about whether this was just. For example, some people might not have had the opportunity to develop the human capital needed to make a large contribution because of their disadvantaged background, or some people might simply not be very skilled, or face barriers due to severe disabilities- does that mean they 'deserve' to live in poverty? Many people, including myself, would say absolutely not.  


So if income doesn't necessarily equal economic contribution, how are we to determine what people's income ""should"" be? This is a question outside the scope of economic analysis, a question which belongs to political philosophy. Economists have a contribution to make to these discussions, in that they can ideally guide us about what social arrangements are economically viable.

Before i started my PhD, I adjuncted for a year at 2 california community colleges and 2 Cal State campuses, and honestly, the amount of driving and worry over whether or not you’ll have enough enrollment to keep your class (and collect a paycheck) is not worth the stress of doing adjunct work. The CCs here generally don’t have full time openings and rely purely on adjunct work (a non negligible amount people on faculty at the places I worked at told me they are career part timers because they could never find a full time gig). 


So with that being said, echoing the other posters, if you’re struggling with linear algebra, then you’re probably gonna have a not so fun time with first year metrics. You don’t have to love math, but you really need to be comfortable enough doing it so that you can survive the coursework. And not just calculus, also proof based math.

Here are some tips for you to follow and hopefully help you with your dissertation process:

**Dissertation Writing Tips**

As already discussed, dissertation can sometimes feel non-achievable but remember nothing is impossible in this world and time. Don’t give such a high pedestal to dissertation and you should be fine. These tips should be enough to guide you on:

**1. Forget the Traditional Methods**

If you ask anyone about some dissertation tips. You will hear only one thing: write, write and write! Research, research and research. Or in other words, simply stay glued to your computer for the next few years of your life. Well these are all false, you shouldn’t stay glued to your screen at all. Instead, go out, take breaks now and then, and refresh yourself before you continue working again!

**2. Let Your Supervisor Control Your Work**

Yes, a supervisor is meant to be your mentor or guide.  Let him guide you and listen to his words, he is 

**3. Write and Take Some Breaks**

While you’re writing, take five or ten minutes break after every fifteen minutes or so. This break allows your hand to take some rest and it also helps you to evaluate what you’ve written. Believe it or not, a small ten-minute break can do wonders after 30 minutes of endless torture.

**4. Don’t Hesitate in Asking for Help**

Help is always available to those who need it. Do not reject the idea of a helping hand because of plagiarism or cheating. Nobody promotes such immoral acts. Help is just what it is, a guidance or some tips to help you achieve better than usual. [Dissertation Writing Services ](https://projectsdeal.co.uk/)can help you with that if you want. They can provide you with good content and enough ways to smooth your dissertation in the best way possible.

**5. Discuss Your Ideas. Correct Topic is 30% Work Done**

Discuss your ideas, look for samples similar to yours on the internet. The more you put you and your words out there, the more you’re likely to receive a positive response. So never hesitate, rather go for it and achieve the most in best way possible!

Topic should have relevance even after dissertation writing is done,

should have good references to research and

most importantly, topic should have good conclusion to score well. You can always take help of [Dissertation Topic](https://projectsdeal.co.uk/).

If you have a Fixed Rate Mortgage, nothing happens.  This is a big part of why Fixed Rate Mortgages are so popular these days.

If you have an Adjustable Rate Mortgage, your payments can go up.  Investopedia provides an adequate explaination of why this happens [here](https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage/mortgage-rates/adjustable-rate-go-up/).  During the 2008 crisis, a large number of people who lost their homes were already on the margin of being able to afford their homes, got hit with rate increases when their ARM rate adjusted, and went into default as well.

There are private as well as public banks, but the market share of public sector banks are higher. Mainly because they hold the salary accounts of all the govt employees, they have more public trust because the govt is sure to bail them out etc.

If the US wants to sell new treasuries (which we do because we're running a massive deficit), we have to find people to buy them, which means we might have to offer higher interest. Somewhat counteracting this is that, if treasury yields increase, China takes a bigger loss. Ultimately, China could sell enough treasuries to increase our debt interest in a very short run, but they would have to take a huge loss to do so, and the treasury market would return to more or less normal conditions pretty quickly.

Now Now 1900 dollars are deposited in the bank. Of the new 900 deposit, 810 dollars are lent out again. Again, they make their way back into the bank to be deposited, and now you have 1000+900+810 dollars. This can keep going on until eventually each successive round gets smaller and smaller, and converges to an amount that is 1/r the original deposit where r is the reserve requirement, in this case 10%. 1/.1=10 so the original deposit of 1000 becomes 10000 through this way.

1576,Serialk,approvecomment,2019-06-21 10:00:59,t1_erogqki,"In the United States, bank runs basically don't happen because the FDIC insures most everyone's deposits. The idea that you need to do a run on the bank is premised on the possibility that you in fact lose all your savings. While I don't have statistics on bank runs that did not cause the bank to fail, according to this working paper:

> A sharp change in the United States banking system occurs with the introduction of federal deposit insurance in 1934, which dramatically reduced the number of bank failures. For reference, more than 13,000 banks failed between 1921 and 1933, and 4,000 banks failed only in 1933. In contrast, a total of 4,057 banks have failed in the United States between 1934 and 2014. As of today, deposit insurance remains a crucial pillar of financial regulation and represents the most salient form of explicit government guarantees to the financial sector. ([Source](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/sites/gsb/files/conference-2016-junior-faculty-workshop-paper-davila.pdf))

While internal data (collected in the run-up to a bank failure so that the FDIC can easily administer the receivership) collected by the FDIC in banks about to fail shows that people who have more than 250k in a bank start fleeing (especially businesses and unions), the proliferation of government-assisted mergers actually means that most of the time, no depositor loses anything in a bank failure. Of course, they don't know the final resolution method, so bank runs can still happen sometimes, but only really in banks with funding structures based around large accounts without pass through insurance (cf pension accounts have pass through meaning each portion is allotted to a person's insurance limit). 

**Who flees?** The people who _are_ vigilant about their uninsured deposits are usually businesses. Generally, they are tipped off by bank insiders or community rumours (though, this may be biased somewhat by the fact that most bank failures are of small community banks). 

Business accounts and transactions can move very quickly and most of those transactions are electronic. ATMs usually have little to do with it because business transactions are so large. This is especially the case given that usually, the ATM balances in Pro forma are quite small relative to total assets. (Pro forma is a balance sheet for the failed bank created to show financial information to possible bank purchasers.)

Usually, however, on bank closing, the wire room is shut down. It is then reopened on Monday with at least 250k liquid assets, or more depending on resolution type (usually a merger). 

**Merger resolutions.** The typical failure ends up with the failed institution being merged into a healthy one. Generally, the buyer of the bank, which must have a good bank health indicator (CAMELS rating 1–2), purchases all the deposits, though we have sometimes done insured-deposit only transactions.

**An example.** For example, Colonial Bank failed in 2009. It was the victim of a fraud scheme where a mortgage seller basically resold a bunch of mortgages multiple times to different people, meaning that Colonial didn't in fact own the things it bought. Even so, BB&T acquired all of the assets and liabilities (e.g. _deposits_) which Colonial Bank owned for a fee paid to them. 

**Least cost.** After the passage of the FDIC Improvement Act in the early 1990s, the FDIC does a least cost test which forces it to choose the resolution method with the lowest cost; sale to BB&T must have been the lowest cost resolution method. In this transaction, no depositor lost anything. The fact that this is and has been a normal practice has led some FDIC chairmen to comment on depositors no longer exercising discipline against badly-capitalised banks (the first thing that comes to mind is a speech by William Isaacs, but I can't recall the citation).

**Payouts.** But when the fraud is at the bank level and the books can't be trusted, the FDIC, lacking a purchaser who is offering a bid that is cheaper to the FDIC than a payout, will simply cut all the depositors a cheque up to their insured deposits. Then, the funds raised in liquidation go towards the uninsured depositors, creditors, etc. generally in that order. 

Naturally, since the bank failed, this isn't always a lot. But normally, uninsured depositors recover around 50-80 per cent of their uninsured deposits in a series of dividends as funds become available, over a period of around 6 months."

I'll provide a little bit of a one-sided argument because you just need to make your case.

For markets to develop (and be ressilient), a society requires a) a centralized power with *de facto* control and b) spread coercive power. Why and what does this mean? If administrative power is not centralized (so a) is violated), upscaling economic activity is not possible. Nobody is enforcing contracts, and trade is mostly on a reputation basis. Upscaling this is not possible, as transaction costs increase (knowing the reputation of everyone in the country is not possible and finding information informally is costly). If this holds but b) is violated we have another problem. Think of a *droit divin*, a king without challenge, who *is* the law. Such a king could arbitrarely take property from traders or producers, and sometimes enforce contracts and sometimes not. This does not help nascent markets.

Feudalism is good in this regard, because there is centralized administrative control (the king). On the other hand, the king does not have (or barely has)  a standing army, and thus does not have a monopoly on violence. Instead, he is dependent on his feudal lords for his actual sovereignty. When conflicts arise between these lords they will need settlement. For this, the lords will demand some sort of consistent legislative treatment for them. This sets a proper basis for legislature which supports the development of markets. It must be noted that this new 'fairness' obviously doesn't really apply to common people.

Greif uses this within a larger argument explaining which countries developped markets earlier (especially looking at England). The papers are good reads and I'd urge you to read them (especially as my summary is not all-encompassing, but I try to refrain from using the terms which need explanation). You however, can use this as an argument in favour of Feudalism. I don't know if you are the king or a lord or what role you play, but you can extrapolate these arguments. Explain how the king is benevolent, and is forced to be so by his wonderful lords. These lords can properly represent local needs and wants and want their towns and cities to flourish. Thus, you ensure, the king will rule fairly between regions (I mean, if he would not he would be killed), and facilitate trade and commerce. This should help all classes of society. Plus, he cannot enter a war unfairly - his lords will not spare their men for that.

However, at the onset of the Meiji Restoration, Western powers forced the country to open up, allowing for import competition through much lower tariffs.

What happened afterward? Well, according to [an article in the American Economic Review](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1b81/eb130b6216973ee884fe2399b7e9bd94929c.pdf?_ga=2.21512510.40268731.1561085711-911157519.1558103516), by being exposed to international markets, Japan was able to experience gains of 8 to 9 percent of its GDP. Indeed, the paper served as a vindication of [David Ricardo's](https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/bios/Ricardo.html) [theory of comparative advantage](https://www.econlib.org/library/Topics/Details/comparativeadvantage.html), which states that countries will improve their welfare if they specialize in industries in which they have a comparative advantage, or in which they face lower opportunity costs."

Federal Deposit Insurance has prevented banking panics fairly well. Accounts up to EDIT: 250 thousand dollars are guaranteed by the government. Since there is no risk of a person losing their money, there is no incentive to run a bank."
1612,AutoModerator,removecomment,2019-06-21 00:55:41,t1_erogqki,"In the United States, bank runs basically don't happen because the FDIC insures most everyone's deposits. The idea that you need to do a run on the bank is premised on the possibility that you in fact lose all your savings. While I don't have statistics on bank runs that did not cause the bank to fail, according to this working paper:

> A sharp change in the United States banking system occurs with the introduction of federal deposit insurance in 1934, which dramatically reduced the number of bank failures. For reference, more than 13,000 banks failed between 1921 and 1933, and 4,000 banks failed only in 1933. In contrast, a total of 4,057 banks have failed in the United States between 1934 and 2014. As of today, deposit insurance remains a crucial pillar of financial regulation and represents the most salient form of explicit government guarantees to the financial sector. ([Source](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/sites/gsb/files/conference-2016-junior-faculty-workshop-paper-davila.pdf))

While internal data (collected in the run-up to a bank failure so that the FDIC can easily administer the receivership) collected by the FDIC in banks about to fail shows that people who have more than 250k in a bank start fleeing (especially businesses and unions), the proliferation of government-assisted mergers actually means that most of the time, no depositor loses anything in a bank failure. Of course, they don't know the final resolution method, so bank runs can still happen sometimes, but only really in banks with funding structures based around large accounts without pass through insurance (cf pension accounts have pass through meaning each portion is allotted to a person's insurance limit). 

**Who flees?** The people who _are_ vigilant about their uninsured deposits are usually businesses. Generally, they are tipped off by bank insiders or community rumours (though, this may be biased somewhat by the fact that most bank failures are of small community banks). 

Business accounts and transactions can move very quickly and most of those transactions are electronic. ATMs usually have little to do with it because business transactions are so large. This is especially the case given that usually, the ATM balances in Pro forma are quite small relative to total assets. (Pro forma is a balance sheet for the failed bank created to show financial information to possible bank purchasers.)

Usually, however, on bank closing, the wire room is shut down. It is then reopened on Monday with at least 250k liquid assets, or more depending on resolution type (usually a merger). 

**Merger resolutions.** The typical failure ends up with the failed institution being merged into a healthy one. Generally, the buyer of the bank, which must have a good bank health indicator (CAMELS rating 1–2), purchases all the deposits, though we have sometimes done insured-deposit only transactions.

**An example.** For example, Colonial Bank failed in 2009. It was the victim of a fraud scheme where a mortgage seller basically resold a bunch of mortgages multiple times to different people, meaning that Colonial didn't in fact own the things it bought. Even so, BB&T acquired all of the assets and liabilities (e.g. _deposits_) which Colonial Bank owned for a fee paid to them. 

**Least cost.** After the passage of the FDIC Improvement Act in the early 1990s, the FDIC does a least cost test which forces it to choose the resolution method with the lowest cost; sale to BB&T must have been the lowest cost resolution method. In this transaction, no depositor lost anything. The fact that this is and has been a normal practice has led some FDIC chairmen to comment on depositors no longer exercising discipline against badly-capitalised banks (the first thing that comes to mind is a speech by William Isaacs, but I can't recall the citation).

**Payouts.** But when the fraud is at the bank level and the books can't be trusted, the FDIC, lacking a purchaser who is offering a bid that is cheaper to the FDIC than a payout, will simply cut all the depositors a cheque up to their insured deposits. Then, the funds raised in liquidation go towards the uninsured depositors, creditors, etc. generally in that order. 

Naturally, since the bank failed, this isn't always a lot. But normally, uninsured depositors recover around 50-80 per cent of their uninsured deposits in a series of dividends as funds become available, over a period of around 6 months."

Once the price changes in the secondary market to say $96, then the current yield changes to \~4.167%. Bond prices and yields are negatively correlated. One goes down, the other goes up. Thus, large treasury sales by China could theoretically push yields on the 10-year treasury up. Given that they probably have a diverse maturity profile of treasuries, they could push yields up along many segments of the treasury yield curve. So in reality, what they are talking about when discussing any country's US Treasury holdings is the secondary market effects that whatever action they take might cause. It does not directly affect the US govt's obligations, because as you noted the US govt is still on the hook for principal and stated coupon. It does affect the market for Treasury bonds themselves though, and that market is essentially a benchmark for new issuance of almost any type of bond. Simplistically speaking, higher treasury yields typically means higher borrowing costs for anyone who issues bonds. This includes corporations issuing debt too, because they have to provide a yield spread above what treasuries (i.e. the ""risk free"" rate) offer. If they didn't, no one would want to take on the extra risk that is inherent with corporate debt.

That said, China's threat to stop buying Treasuries is a hallow one at best. Most of the world's global trade is done in dollars, and almost all oil trade is done in dollars (hence, the petrodollar). This is why the world's reserve currency is dollars, and it is why we control the global financial system that allows us to penalize countries for engaging ""bad actor"" countries (think the sanctions on Iran). If China started to sell US Treasuries, what are they going to buy that has the issuance or secondary market supply they would need to accommodate that amount of money moving from Treasuries?

&#x200B;

This is an largely uninformed guess, but what they are probably doing right now is taking gains given the recent treasury rally. The entire treasury yield curve is down like 15-25% in 2019 depending on what point on the curve you're looking at, which means that treasury prices are up. Despite the threats and saber rattling in the media over this topic, it just wouldn't make practical sense for China to politicize this with the US dollar still the reserve currency of the world."
1645,blurryk,approvecomment,2019-06-20 14:58:59,t1_erko2kd,"Treasury bonds are used as a form of money in the global markets. China has a huge position, and by dumping them into the market in a short time period, they can material affect the prices. 

The prices of treasury bonds would drop, and people could buy them at a cheaper price. China would likely give them up at a loss. Anybody else in the market who needs to sell their bonds would also likely have to do so at a loss. 

This would extend from treasuries to agencies, municipals, mortgage-backed, and corporate bonds (any bond really) since treasuries are used as the “risk free” rate. 

There would then be a liquidity crisis in that there would not be enough buyers for fixed income in the market. The fed would likely just resume the asset repurchase program (QE) to suck up the excess treasuries in the market."

The idea is called 'sterilization' and China is 'unsertilizing' or 'floating' these bonds.  

But first we need to hit another basic economic principle: the UST printing a bond has *exactly* the same impact as printing cash.  Think about it this way, in a 0% interest rate environment, a $100 bill is identical to a UST zero-coupon bond with X maturity.  With me so far?  If we add in an interest rate, the UST issuing (say) a 1yr UST zero with $100 maturity and an implied rate of (say) 3% is identical to the UST printing a purely hypothetical '$97 bill' today.  Still with me?  Lastly, we also know that any complex UST bond can be synthetically replicated with structured zero coupon bonds (and if necessary synthetic rate/inflation swaps).  In plain english, you can buy a whole series of UST zeros that *exactly* replicate a UST bond that (say) pays $X every 6mo for 10yrs and then $Y at maturity, and you can do this for every UST security.  In its simplest form, this whole market is called the Treasury STRIPS market, and its the 'mechanical link' that ties together floating USTs and 'to be issued' USTs.  Think of it as a 'check' that makes sure that there are no arbitrages.  (Side note: exploiting these small pricing differences between existing USTs, their synthetic counterparts, and 'on the run' USTs was the strategy that Long Term Capital Management was using....for a while.) 

So: printing bonds is the exact same as printing cash.  I don't have the time to fully explain this now, but the 'moment of inflation' (eg, the exact timing of when the inflation occurs from printing cash v bonds is identical too.)  Theres a TON of myth around people saying 'we have to print a ton of cash to pay off the deficit which will trigger inflation.'  This is wrong - if you print to pay off a bond, there is no inflation impact b/c you experienced the inflation the moment the bond entered the economy.  I used to use Monopoly to teach this to junior bankers back in the day.

Now sterilization:  a $100 bill 'impacts' the US economy to the extent that it is *IN* in the economy and transferring value between parties.  This should be fairly intuitive.  If you went to the UST in Washington DC, got your hands on a brand new $100 bill, and then spent it - that $100bill will contribute to the economy and have a micro, micro impact on the broader US economy.  HOWEVER, if you take that $100 bill, and buried it in your back yard, it will never contribute to the economy - it has been 'sterilized'.  Because we know that UST=$100bill, you could also take an off the run UST and bury it, it will be 'sterilized.'

Now to China.  For the past ~20 years, China has been the biggest foreign buyer of USTs (and Japan and Germany/Europe).  They do this b/c they are trying to keep their currency cheap compared to the USD, but CHina is (by far) the biggest buyer.  In plain english, we have been flooding the world with USTs and as a result, the USD should be *a lot* weaker than it is now.  But a weak dollar is very bad for countries that import into the US.  So those countries exposed to a weak USD, have been buying and sterilizing USTs for 20 years.  This is the root of the US's claims that China is a currency manipulator - China has been buying USTs by the trillions - and 'sterilizing' them - to keep their currency cheap relative to the USD.   Same with the Yen and to a *far* lesser degree the euro.  But we have good relations with Japan/Europe, so we don't call them currency manipulators.  

Now China is threatening to reverse that by floating a chunk of their USTs.  The impact will be to weaken the USD relative to other currencies.....which honestly isn't that big of a deal in my opinion.  Just say for sake of argument that the USD weakens by 20% over the next year: oil will be ~$10/bbl more expensive, US imports will be a little more expensive and exports will be a little more valuable - but the trade gap won't move a *ton* as a % of GDP.  It *does* have the impact of exacerbating the tariffs, which is a net 'bad'.  Additionally, we could see a trickle through of somewhat higher inflation in the US, but an additional 2% to 3% inflation would probably be a *good* thing as long as its spread widely across the whole economy (eg, not just concentrated in, say, energy and housing). In econ terms, its 'pro-cyclical velocity', whcih we *need* right now.  

But in total, I don't know too many people that are *really* freaked out about it on Wall St - its an interesting talking point, but not a 'holy shit' thing.  People are bracing for it the same way you'd brace for a ~100bps Fed rate cut (eg, just be ready for a weaker dollar), but the Fed can basically just raise/hold rates if it becomes an issue.  If China were to *really* float all of their USTs *and* the yuan, it would devastate *their* economy b/c they would effectively price themselves out of the global economy.

Karl Marx commended Fuedalism as a system that wasn't quite as good as Capitalism but it was a lot better than the past. (in the voice of somebody who is pro feudalist)  Slavery was a system from the past. It was in everybody's best interest to do away with that system. Slavery is fine if your workers are only going to be planting crops. but as soon as you give them tools or take your eyes off them they break the tools or run away. Even besides being better for business the serfs are much better off don't you think? Being forced to work someone else's land for the minimum amount of food required to live, not even owning themselves. They can have a family. They can't be forced off the land. they can even leave an inheritance. all they have to do is pay a little bit of taxes to the lords that are not too bad.  


Now if you wanted to say Feudalism was better than capitalism you could try to argue that under Feudalism the serfs at least pretend like they own something from the land and that they work on. The worker under capitalism doesn't even get to keep the fruits of his labor. And some of the fruits of his work still go to taxes which are the only bad part of Feudalism."

The gold standard necessarily involves a fixed rate of convertibility of money into gold and vice versa. In other words: a price control. This will result in less gold than is economically efficient being delivered to market if it's a price ceiling, which the US gold standard was or too much gold being delivered to market, which would inefficiently move valuable resources from higher and better uses. 

A gold standard would also necessitate massive holdings of gold by either the treasury or federal reserve, which would prevent demanders of gold from consuming their desired commodity. In the 1900s this was relatively minor, but nowadays that would mean depriving the tech sector from an important factor of production, which would have effects throughout the rest of the economy that relies on it, increasing the price of capital investment, and in the long term stunting growth."

Karl Marx commended Fuedalism as a system that wasn't quite as good as Capitalism but it was a lot better than the past. (in the voice of somebody who is pro feudalist)  Slavery was a system from the past. It was in everybody's best interest to do away with that system. Slavery is fine if your workers are only going to be planting crops. but as soon as you give them tools or take your eyes off them they break the tools or run away. Even besides being better for business the serfs are much better off don't you think? Being forced to work someone else's land for the minimum amount of food required to live, not even owning themselves. They can have a family. They can't be forced off the land. they can even leave an inheritance. all they have to do is pay a little bit of taxes to the lords that are not too bad.  


Now if you wanted to say Feudalism was better than capitalism you could try to argue that under Feudalism the serfs at least pretend like they own something from the land and that they work on. The worker under capitalism doesn't even get to keep the fruits of his labor. And some of the fruits of his work still go to taxes which are the only bad part of Feudalism."

If there is more selling than buying, then the benchmark price of for that maturity segment of bonds goes down. If the bond pays $4 per $100 par at issue, then that yield is originally 4%. Once the price changes in the secondary market to say $96, then the current yield changes to \~4.167%. Bond prices and yields are negatively correlated. One goes down, the other goes up. Thus, large treasury sales by China could theoretically push yields on the 10-year treasury up. Given that they probably have a diverse maturity profile of treasuries, they could push yields up along many segments of the treasury yield curve. So in reality, what they are talking about when discussing any country's US Treasury holdings is the secondary market effects that whatever action they take might cause. It does not directly affect the US govt's obligations, because as you noted the US govt is still on the hook for principal and stated coupon. It does affect the market for Treasury bonds themselves though, and that market is essentially a benchmark for new issuance of almost any type of bond. Simplistically speaking, higher treasury yields typically means higher borrowing costs for anyone who issues bonds. This includes corporations issuing debt too, because they have to provide a yield spread above what treasuries (i.e. the ""risk free"" rate) offer. If they didn't, no one would want to take on the extra risk that is inherent with corporate debt.

&#x200B;

That said, China's threat to stop buying Treasuries is a hallow one at best. Most of the world's global trade is done in dollars, and almost all oil trade is done in dollars (hence, the petrodollar). This is why the world's reserve currency is dollars, and it is why we control the global financial system that allows us to penalize countries for engaging ""bad actor"" countries (think the sanctions on Iran). If China started to sell US Treasuries, what are they going to buy that has the issuance or secondary market supply they would need to accommodate that amount of money moving from Treasuries? Negative yielding German bunds? Maybe, but the buyers of German bunds they just displaced would then need to find somewhere else to park their money. And what government debt would have just had large amount being routinely dumped on the secondary market in that scenario? The US treasury market...

&#x200B;

This is an largely uninformed guess, but what they are probably doing right now is taking gains given the recent treasury rally. The entire treasury yield curve is down like 15-25% in 2019 depending on what point on the curve you're looking at, which means that treasury prices are up.

1732,Iamthelolrus,approvecomment,2019-06-19 17:08:15,t1_erk5kvs,"Here's one issue: It is difficult to run a gold standard in a democracy. 

To see this, note that there are (mainly) four ways to get a country out of a financial crisis, inflate, deflate, devalue, and default. If your currency is on a gold standard, inflation and devaluation are no options. You generally want to avoid defaulting. This leaves deflation, i.e. cutting wages and government spending. Naturally, people are not too happy with this. So if your country is under democratic control, you will see only so many rounds of austerity before someone is elected that drops the gold standard for fiat money. 

If you are interested, the following passage from Mark Blyth' book [Austerity](http://markblyth.com/books/austerity-the-history-of-a-dangerous-idea/) summarizes some of the advantages and disadvantages of the gold standard. 

>Today, many seemingly sensible people on both sides of the Atlantic, but particularly in the United States, seem to think that the solution to any and all economic problems lies in returning to something called the gold standard. This is odd because apart from being a heavy, shiny rock, gold has no particular noteworthy features—besides being a major contributory cause of the two worst economic depressions in world history: the 1870s and the 1930s. I can only assume that the folks peddling the return of gold as a good idea are ignorant of the actual history of the gold standard. Working on that assumption, and to enable us to understand why austerity in the 1920s and 1930s lasted so long, did so much damage, and why its history matters for the Eurozone today, it is worth revisiting the workings of the gold standard.

>The gold standard was built during the nineteenth century because of a problem endemic to international trade. Namely, how do you know that when you hand over your goods (an export) to someone far away, that the money in which they will pay you back (as payment for their import) is not just a pile of worthless paper—the so-called fiat money problem? The answer is, you don’t know, and so international trade was historically limited by the extent to which trust could be maintained, or hostages, literally, could be exchanged.

>The gold standard solved this problem of trust by eliminating the need for it. The solution was to tie the notional value of different national currencies to gold at a fixed rate, gold being a conventional store of value that both is internationally exchangeable and cannot (easily) be altered by governments. X units of currency Y therefore could be exchanged everywhere for Z units of gold. And if all countries “pegged” their currencies to gold in this way, it facilitated trade by solving the fiat money/trust problem.

>Since each country is pegged to gold at a fixed rate, when you earn foreign currency through trade, you can, in principle, take it back to the issuing country’s central bank and ask for the gold that backs it. Because the paper you now hold is convertible for gold at a fixed rate, the paper will be exactly equal in value to gold. So long as this promise of convertibility is maintained, you don’t have to worry about the value of the paper you are holding. If, however, a country on gold decides to run the printing presses to pay for imports in excess of their gold reserves, then that excess currency will show up in the countries exporting to these inflationistas.

>No longer trusting the pegged rate, the receiving country could return these notes to the issuing country for exchange, where the repatriated currency would be in excess of the available gold. Their reserves, sometimes called their “gold cover,” would be insufficient to cope with demand. This would call everyone’s attention to the fact that the issuing country is inflating its currency—issuing more than can be backed by gold at the fixed rate. This would cause people to lose confidence in that currency and dump it en masse, ending convertibility, and wrecking the offending economy in the process. Being on gold therefore gave holders of a foreign currency a “credible” signal that the money was “sound,” so long as convertibility was maintained.

>But that wasn’t the half of it. The gold standard also worked as a mechanism of adjustment for international trade by bringing states’ exports and imports into balance through the inflation and deflation of domestic prices and wages. For example, if a country on gold exported more than it imported, it would, in effect, be importing gold from the recipient countries. This would add to its own domestic money supply, enabling the issuance of more domestic currency. It would also raise wages and prices as the economy boomed but It would also make its exports less competitive and its imports cheaper. Over time, this country’s trade surplus would turn into a trade deficit, with more imports than exports. Gold would move out of the country to pay for these increased imports. Domestic prices and wages would fall as the money supply (tied to gold) shrank, but the country’s competitiveness would improve (cheaper exports), and the trade balance would right itself as exports picked up and imports fell.

>With everyone on the gold standard being open to trade and financial flows, the promise of convertibility combined with the flexibility of prices and wages to act as the mechanism of adjustment to ensure that the global economy produced a balance between imports and exports in one country and a balance across the system of countries as a whole. This is how the gold standard created the conditions for the growth of trade across the world, free from government interference and the danger of inflation. It was self-regulating, automatic, and impersonal—which was precisely the problem the moment ordinary people got involved.

>You don’t have to be a public choice theorist to see that you can only really run a system like this, where domestic wages and prices do most of the adjusting to external prices, if you are not a democracy. While widgets, potatoes, steel, and pneumatic pumps care not one jot about their supply price, labor most certainly does care, especially when that price (wages) goes down. By making the mechanism of adjustment the random inflation and deflation of prices and wages, a great deal of uncertainty, and unemployment, was created in these economies. It also created conditions where the domestic monetary authorities, to maintain that all important gold cover, would pursue austerity policies such as cutting spending and raising interest rates to shrink deficits, keep gold at home, and defend the currency. It was hardly surprising, then, that it was under the gold standard that labor across the world, both industrial and agricultural, started to join together in unions, political parties, and social movements to demand protection from the vagaries of the market and the policies of their own governments.

>Making this worse apart from the effect of austerity policies, the global supply of gold puts a ceiling on growth. If trade demand increases faster than the money supply, and the money supply is limited by the gold supply, interest rates will rise and the economy will slump in response. The gold standard had, then, an inbuilt contractionary bias. It could solve the problem of inflation, but only at the price of creating deflation. Deflation is a particularly pernicious problem because in a deflation everyone’s first best guess about what to do to protect themselves—for example, workers taking a pay cut to price themselves into a job—has the aggregate effect of cutting consumption, which shrinks the economy and makes everyone’s unemployment all the more likely. States with large trade or budget deficits going into a recession fare especially badly in such situations because it becomes almost impossible to grow out of the problem as recession and deflation compound each other. Taking on more loans and more debt to gain temporary relief will not help in the long run because you cannot grow out of it."

These are just two sides of the same coin, the point being that if there are either more demand or less supply, the price will go up. In a more dynamic model this could lead to more suppliers being able to produce since the subsidies make it profitable with higher production cost before, but now we are getting ahead of ourselves =)

1737,AutoModerator,removecomment,2019-06-19 17:00:16,t1_erkhkap,"Very complicated question. The essential or ELI5 version is:

Global commodities are priced in US Dollars (USD) since the end of WW2.

The People's Republic of China (PRC) needs USD to trade with other countries around the globe.

The PRC has a USD shortage, therefore the PRC sells its US treasury holdings, which it acquired over the course of decades as a form of savings, for USD today, which it then exchanges for other things like soybean, copper, and oil.

In addition to this phenomena, the PRC maintains a 'peg' or government set exchange ratio between its currency and the US Dollar.

The PRC's currency is the 'renminbi.' There is a domestic, that is to say, used internally in China renminbi, and an international, or ""off-shore"" renminbi. It is a single currency, but trades at different exchange rates to the US Dollar.

For the PRC to maintain its peg to the US Dollar, the Chinese government must manipulate the natural market supply/demand of on-shore renminbi by selling and buying as required to meet their mandated price ratio.

This requires additional US Dollars, as in any exchange, or trade, there is both a buyer and a seller. One who is selling the renminbi and buying USD, and one who is buying renminbi and selling USD.

&#x200B;

>But whether the US pay the money to China, or to someone else, doesn't really matter, or does it?

It does and it doesn't. The US Federal Government borrowed savings by selling ""treasuries,"" or ""bonds,"" and must pay back its debt as prescribed by the obligation to the holder of the obligation, that is, whoever owns the debt.

Now if the debt of one government is held by a 'hostile' government elsewhere, you can presumably see a situation where the indebted government might decide it is advantageous to default on its debt. Of course this has other implications of trustworthiness in the future and other major historical consequences. The oft-cited historical example is the Weimar Republic following WW1 and the collapse of the German Empire, leading into WW2.

&#x200B;

>So why should China selling US t-bonds have any effect on the US economy?

In the immediate term, it makes no noticeable difference besides how a given bond may be trading on any given day. Over the course of decades, it will alter the macro form an economy takes, as competitive advantages among many varied and complex factors take shape, including the currency exchange ratio values as the result of flows of capital from savers to borrowers, or sellers and buyers, and the nature of the borrowing taking place: long-term capital investment or immediate consumption.

Reagan's tax cuts decreased the number of tax brackets from 15 to 4, so it seems plausible that federal tax revenue in the post-cut top bracket was higher than the pre-cut top bracket largely because there were more tax payers in the post-cut top bracket.

Also worth keeping in mind that even if we were to only look at tax revenue from individuals that were in the pre-cut top bracket and find that it increased after the cuts, this alone would not be enough to conclude a causal relationship between tax cuts and revenue without considering other economic factors.

All of this is to say that I'm not really sure that the problem you are trying to solve exists.

1761,AutoModerator,removecomment,2019-06-19 14:50:48,t1_erk5kvs,"Here's one issue: It is difficult to run a gold standard in a democracy. 

To see this, note that there are (mainly) four ways to get a country out of a financial crisis, inflate, deflate, devalue, and default. If your currency is on a gold standard, inflation and devaluation are no options. You generally want to avoid defaulting. This leaves deflation, i.e. cutting wages and government spending. Naturally, people are not too happy with this. So if your country is under democratic control, you will see only so many rounds of austerity before someone is elected that drops the gold standard for fiat money. 

If you are interested, the following passage from Mark Blyth' book [Austerity](http://markblyth.com/books/austerity-the-history-of-a-dangerous-idea/) summarizes some of the advantages and disadvantages of the gold standard. 

>Today, many seemingly sensible people on both sides of the Atlantic, but particularly in the United States, seem to think that the solution to any and all economic problems lies in returning to something called the gold standard. This is odd because apart from being a heavy, shiny rock, gold has no particular noteworthy features—besides being a major contributory cause of the two worst economic depressions in world history: the 1870s and the 1930s. I can only assume that the folks peddling the return of gold as a good idea are ignorant of the actual history of the gold standard. Working on that assumption, and to enable us to understand why austerity in the 1920s and 1930s lasted so long, did so much damage, and why its history matters for the Eurozone today, it is worth revisiting the workings of the gold standard.

>The gold standard was built during the nineteenth century because of a problem endemic to international trade. Namely, how do you know that when you hand over your goods (an export) to someone far away, that the money in which they will pay you back (as payment for their import) is not just a pile of worthless paper—the so-called fiat money problem? The answer is, you don’t know, and so international trade was historically limited by the extent to which trust could be maintained, or hostages, literally, could be exchanged.

>The gold standard solved this problem of trust by eliminating the need for it. The solution was to tie the notional value of different national currencies to gold at a fixed rate, gold being a conventional store of value that both is internationally exchangeable and cannot (easily) be altered by governments. X units of currency Y therefore could be exchanged everywhere for Z units of gold. And if all countries “pegged” their currencies to gold in this way, it facilitated trade by solving the fiat money/trust problem.

>Since each country is pegged to gold at a fixed rate, when you earn foreign currency through trade, you can, in principle, take it back to the issuing country’s central bank and ask for the gold that backs it. Because the paper you now hold is convertible for gold at a fixed rate, the paper will be exactly equal in value to gold. So long as this promise of convertibility is maintained, you don’t have to worry about the value of the paper you are holding. If, however, a country on gold decides to run the printing presses to pay for imports in excess of their gold reserves, then that excess currency will show up in the countries exporting to these inflationistas.

>No longer trusting the pegged rate, the receiving country could return these notes to the issuing country for exchange, where the repatriated currency would be in excess of the available gold. Their reserves, sometimes called their “gold cover,” would be insufficient to cope with demand. This would call everyone’s attention to the fact that the issuing country is inflating its currency—issuing more than can be backed by gold at the fixed rate. This would cause people to lose confidence in that currency and dump it en masse, ending convertibility, and wrecking the offending economy in the process. Being on gold therefore gave holders of a foreign currency a “credible” signal that the money was “sound,” so long as convertibility was maintained.

>But that wasn’t the half of it. The gold standard also worked as a mechanism of adjustment for international trade by bringing states’ exports and imports into balance through the inflation and deflation of domestic prices and wages. For example, if a country on gold exported more than it imported, it would, in effect, be importing gold from the recipient countries. This would add to its own domestic money supply, enabling the issuance of more domestic currency. It would also raise wages and prices as the economy boomed but It would also make its exports less competitive and its imports cheaper. Over time, this country’s trade surplus would turn into a trade deficit, with more imports than exports. Gold would move out of the country to pay for these increased imports. Domestic prices and wages would fall as the money supply (tied to gold) shrank, but the country’s competitiveness would improve (cheaper exports), and the trade balance would right itself as exports picked up and imports fell.

>With everyone on the gold standard being open to trade and financial flows, the promise of convertibility combined with the flexibility of prices and wages to act as the mechanism of adjustment to ensure that the global economy produced a balance between imports and exports in one country and a balance across the system of countries as a whole. This is how the gold standard created the conditions for the growth of trade across the world, free from government interference and the danger of inflation. It was self-regulating, automatic, and impersonal—which was precisely the problem the moment ordinary people got involved.

>You don’t have to be a public choice theorist to see that you can only really run a system like this, where domestic wages and prices do most of the adjusting to external prices, if you are not a democracy.

An average person is not able to judge the quality of formula, and place of origin is the factor that they've decided signals something that is safe because of milk product quality scandals that have happened in the past. I would wager that there is almost certainly good quality formula produced domestically, but there's going to be a lag in perceptions catching up.

Also, at least some of the people traveling abroad from China to buy stuff to bring back and sell are usually small businesses or individuals operating with gray market items. They have a specific name for it here (dai gou 代购), and they are probably also buying other items. What's happening is that they are buying things that are not illegal, but also not for sale on the local market such as IQOS e-cigarettes, or they are buying things that are taxed heavily on import such as some luxury goods. You could just call it smuggling I guess."

Most people slightly get mistaken here. Economics is more about getting the most optimal solution with least effort.

Sure, you'll have to pay $20 one way ride as compared to $4 in public transport. But that'll increase your morale and boost some output value."

In short, yes, it's pretty spot on accurate except for the last point. From a therapeutic standpoint, modern medicine has been seeing diminishing returns for decades.

I say this tongue in cheek, because I know pharma is raking in lots of money and overall the industry is doing alright, but that's because they're playing the game you're criticizing. They're also still working on real, difficult problems like Alzheimer's, but it's difficult in an era where the #1 objective for corporations is to fulfill Friedman's doctrine of maximizing shareholder returns. Losing billions of dollars on a failed Alzheimer's drug tends to make the shareholders unhappy, whereas making billions on a mostly needless drug like Lucemyra makes them happy. Ultimately, pharma companies have to compete in the stock market against companies like Apple, Google, Facebook, Netflix, etc. These companies are absolutely drowning in cash. Why would you buy stock in pharma companies if they aren't drowning in cash too?

>As long as doctors continue to outsource their thinking to the FDA approval process, in a way even the FDA itself doesn’t endorse, pharma companies will be able to inflate the prices of basic medications by a thousand times just by playing games with the bureaucracy.

This is the part I vehemently disagree with. Doctors aren't outsourcing their thinking to the FDA approval process. The problem is that no one wants to do huge expensive studies with drugs like clonidine, because there's no money in that. That's why it doesn't have FDA approval. The clinical evidence does show Lucemyra causes less hypotension. The author writes that off as as no big deal, but I can tell you hypotension is definitely a big deal for older patients who often have half a dozen severe co-morbidities. No, it's not a problem with young, healthy kids, but that's not the target patient population for Lucemyra.

At the end of the day though, very few doctors in the U.S. have even heard of Lucemyra and even fewer are using it. The era of drug reps wining and dining doctors to push questionable drugs has been over for a long time because regulators cracked down on it (the heydey was the late 90s and early 2000s). I'm not saying there aren't any corrupt doctors receiving kickbacks through loopholes here and there, but for the most part regulators are policing it pretty vigilantly these days.

Lastly, a quick google search shows that [Lucemyra can conceivably be purchased for $50/month](https://prescriptionhope.com/lucemyra-lofexidine/). That's still 10x as expensive as clonidine, but it's cheap enough that if a patient can't tolerate clonidine due to hypotension or some other reason, they might be willing to try Lucemyra. In a lot of cases, patients don't end up directly paying the full cost of these expensive drugs--insurance covers most of it. Of course, due to the nature of the U.S. insurance system, this raises premiums for the self-employed. But I suppose a fuller discussion on the broken nature of the U.S. insurance and healthcare systems is a topic for another day."

 ***Freakonomics*** is a great and fun book to start with. It'll give you a sample of various topics and turn what you may have thought was common sense, on its head.

***Why Nations Fail***. If you are looking for a longer book that isn't too hard to read, I really enjoyed this one. The book starts by discussing several popular theories on why some nations are more successful than others. It then proceeds to destroy those theories with counter-examples before finally developing its own theory. I haven't been able to find a single example that contradicts the author's theory. Reading that book will likely give you a new perspective on the future of countries like China, the U.S.A., and Russia. Additionally, you'll have a better understanding of why some nations failing was inevitable such as Rome and the U.S.S.R. If you're interested in macroeconomics, this book may be a good fit.

***After the Music Stopped***. This book revolves around the 2008 financial crisis. It discusses everything from macro-economic policies to individual business actions. It's a great book that I plan on re-reading. It's written in such a way that you don't need any economic background to understand it although, it certainly helps if you do!

***Why Nations Fail***. If you are looking for a longer book that isn't too hard to read, I really enjoyed this one. The book starts by discussing several popular theories on why some nations are more successful than others. It then proceeds to destroy those theories with counter-examples before finally developing its own theory. I haven't been able to find a single example that contradicts the author's theory. Reading that book will likely give you a new perspective on the future of countries like China, the U.S.A., and Russia. Additionally, you'll have a better understanding of why some nations failing was inevitable such as Rome and the U.S.S.R. If you're interested in macroeconomics, this book may be a good fit.

***After the Music Stopped***. This book revolves around the 2008 financial crisis. It discusses everything from macro-economic policies to individual business actions. It's a great book that I plan on re-reading. It's written in such a way that you don't need any economic background to understand it although, it certainly helps if you do!

1836,blurryk,approvecomment,2019-06-18 15:33:30,t1_ergjx8y,">One of the problems of a progressive tax rate system is that it disincentivizes movement up the income ladder. Tax cuts in the 80s, I believe, actually happened to provide higher Federal revenue (for the top marginal bracket only) by incentivizing movement up the income ladder (or in other words, making it much more appealing to take a higher position)

Well, it does, kinda, of you squint a bit. But I think most who are up in arms about something like this simply don't understand the tax system.

If you move up a tax bracket and your income is taxed higher, *only the income that falls into that bracket* is taxed higher.

So let's say we have three brackets, 0-10k with 0% tax, 10-20k with 25% tax, and 20k and up with 50% tax.

If you currently earn 10k and pay zero taxes, and you then earn 11k, you don't suddenly pay 25% tax on all of those 11k. You only pay 25% on the 1k that's above the 0-10k bracket. So instead of your income after tax jumping from 10k to 5.5k, it jumps from 10k to 10.75k.

In the same vein, if you now earn 25k, the first 10k aren't taxed, the second 10k are taxed at 25%, and the remaining 5k are taxed at 50%, that comes out to 20k of after tax income.

Moving up a tax bracket *always* makes you richer simply because you earn more money. Even if the ""new"" money is taxed super high.

Let's take that previous example, 25k before tax, 20k after tax. Now there's a new bracket, that taxes income above 25k at 99%. So if you earn 26k, you take home 20.01k. Not a lot more, because those extra 1k are taxed at 99%, but you still get more.

Of course, if you combine that with some other things, maybe you wouldn't want to earn more. Let's say you earn 25k right now, and to earn more, you have to work 6 hours a week more, only to end up with very little extra income. That's of course not worth it to you. But that of course depends on more factors than just the tax code, and of course it's something people know and can anticipate, so they might for example want to negotiate an even higher pre-tax raise to offset a high tax on the additional income.

That said, this is also an intentional design decision of the tax system. You *want* to tax people higher if they earn more, because every extra dollar is ""worth"" less to them.

Let's say for example you have 0 dollars in the bank, your paycheck is still a week away. 50$ might save you from starving for a few days, and every dollar and every nickel you find under a couch cushion or whatever might help you immensely. On the other hand, someone with half a million dollars doesn't necessarily care that much about 50 bucks, they certainly don't need it to survive, they might not even notice if they are missing 50$. So you tax them more, because having a bit less money ""hurts"" them way less than someone who has a lot less money.

E:

>would a possible solution be a system in which individuals pay their current annual income tax based on their income one year ago?

That's basically a tax break, even if it's a temporary one, that would make the whole thing a bit more regressive. Sure, people most likely wouldn't say no to paying a bit less in taxes.

And if the underlying issue really is people not understanding the tax system, ""fixing"" it by giving out tax breaks doesn't sound like a particularly effective solution. Taking income tax alone, there's no scenario where you'd be poorer after a raise because you pay more taxes. (Although I don't know the US tax system in particular well enough to know if that might not still happen under certain circumstances because of other taxes and fees.)"

Some people think we should have ""catch up inflation"" in order to make up for that. These people prefer price level targeting over inflation targeting.

Now you are right that price level targeting can sometimes be pro-cyclical. That is one criticism of price level targeting. However people like price level targeting because it's primarily a matter of credibility for the Fed. If the Fed fails to hit its target, markets would be more confident that the Fed will be extra aggressive in the future if we had price level targeting. [Bernanke](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/ben-bernanke/2017/10/12/temporary-price-level-targeting-an-alternative-framework-for-monetary-policy/) has suggested temporary price level targeting as a way to  out of the zero lower bound.

Another way around the pro-cyclical inflation problem is to do [NGDP level targeting](https://www.econlib.org/archives/2017/04/avoid_procyclic.html). There's basically no risk of pro-cyclical inflation under a rule based on the level of NGDP."

The holder of the CDS takes the opposite side and in case of an event receives the notional.  The holder also promises to pay premiums for this insurance, upfront and/or at specified intervals (e.g. quarterly).

Finding detailed information about a particular contract, in particular the notional amount or the premium and its payment schedule, is difficult: CDS contracts are traded OTC (directly between the two parties), i.e. there is no central exchange where holders and writers meet unlike the stock market for instance.

Second, CDS contracts are not standardized, that is the two parties could agree on arbitrary clauses (terms).  The only standardized thing is the event in question and possibly naming the class of debt (senior, subordinated, etc.) or a particular bond or a particular series of coupons, etc.  

Third, neither party has the obligation to disclose any of the terms, just like you don't have to publish the terms of your life insurance policy.

These are just two sides of the same coin, the point being that if there are either more demand or less supply, the price will go up. In a more dynamic model this could lead to more suppliers being able to produce since the subsidies make it profitable with higher production cost before, but now we are getting ahead of ourselves =)

3) Quantitative Easing - Without a floating exchange rate, quantative Easing  is not possible. This would have made 2008 crisis as big as the 1930s. 

4) Inflation- Those who argue that inflation rate is controlled under the gold standard are not seeing the hard facts. Inflation was worse during the gold standard times

The only real advantage of gold standard is that monetary policy coordination is better, which is important for global financial stability. But on the whole, we are better off without it."

Also there are a cultural and historical factors in Argentinian people, forced for past crisis and devaluation (e.g: ""el corralito""),  caused untrust in our currency, making us think  it's not a strong way for saving or investing.

Also worth keeping in mind that even if we were to only look at tax revenue from individuals that were in the pre-cut top bracket and find that it increased after the cuts, this alone would not be enough to conclude a causal relationship between tax cuts and revenue without considering other economic factors.

All of this is to say that I'm not really sure that the problem you are trying to solve exists.

The GOP has held either the House or the Executive branch for all but 4 of the last 40 years, and they are convinced that minimum wage laws are bad.

Another factor is a large decease in worker unionization. There has been a pretty concerted effort on the part of corporate lobbyists to erode union power over the last 40 years. Setting aside the question of whether unions are good for the economy, they do at least give workers more negotiating power. Imagine if there was a powerful national Retail Workers Union that all retail workers belonged to. At the same time, both technology and globalization have completely changed the corporate climate and the national economy. Rather than increase wages, corporations tend to rely on automation and outsourcing. Instead of competing with a national pool of wage workers, you now have to compete with a global pool of wage workers.

Let’s start with an easy approach to thinking about this. What does the “bottom 10%” look like?  For the most part, the bottom 10% of wage-earners are high school/college kids and various minimum wage workers.  As it turns out, entry-level work of this sort of thing just doesn’t pay all that much, in part because there has (for a long time now) been an ever growing population of “new young people” willing to start their careers on this rung of the economic ladder, meaning the supply of low-skill labor has been increasing over time.  Some people argue that this is changing, citing decreasing high school enrollment as evidence of decreasing population growth. 

Another aspect of this is the recent influx of college grads taking these kinds of jobs, which only increases the supply of labor in the low-skill-labor market even more.  Why are so many college grads taking these jobs?  I have a lot of thoughts on this, but a lot of it can be summed up as “because higher education has become a shell of its former self.”  Today, an insane number of people go to college. But, and to put it bluntly, about half of college students probably shouldn’t be there to begin with.  This isn’t saying that they’re dumb or anything; it’s just that college isn’t really for them.  One of my best friends is one of these people.  He flunked out of college, found a job at a UPS store, got super into thinking about business and logistics, and now he owns the store he used to work at and is about to expand to buying a second store.  He’s pulling down somewhere around $180k about now, providing for his lovely kids and wife, and really enjoying life.  He works really hard, but he loves it.

Colleges don’t like it when people flunk out.  They lose not only the tuition that the person would pay, but oftentimes they lose out on state/federal subsidies for having a certain number of students.  This is especially true at smaller colleges.  At the school I work at, we had 20 students transfer between the fall and spring semesters.  This actually had a really big impact on our budget, and several offices had to make cuts to their budgets/not hire an additional worker.

One solution that a lot of colleges are (regrettably) taking is to water down the degree.  Gone are the days where knowing basic calculus is expected of all college grads.  A class called “college algebra” will do in most cases.  While this makes it easier for students to stay enrolled, it has the downside of arming them with fewer skills upon graduation.

As a result, college has become increasingly about 1) what school you went to and (relatedly) 2) who you met while you were in school and much, much less about 3) what you know and 4) what you studied.

EDIT:

I should also add a bit about why the wages of the top 10% have gone up so much relative to the bottom 10%, which have largely stagnated.

If you track individual people’s wages over time, you’ll find that, with very few exceptions (much fewer than you might be led to believe), wages go up every year.  In fact, every generation can reasonably expect to be about twice as wealthy *in real terms* (if you control for inflation properly, which is absurdly hard to do in the age of computers) as their parents.  This is fantastic.  So while everyone’s wages are going up over time as they continue to work, the people who are just starting out on their journeys are still starting at the low, entry level wage.

One image to help picture this is to think about those telescoping ladders that used to be sold on HSN back in the day.  The ladder only has a certain number of rungs on it.  When you compress the ladder down, all the rungs are really close together.  But when you extend the ladder, the bottom run stays exactly as high as it was (remains stagnant) while the top rung goes higher and higher.

When people divide the income distribution into deciles and then talk about how the top decile is getting higher and higher while the bottom decile is remaining stagnant, they’re basically talking about a collapsable ladder being extended.  So they’re right to point out that “the top 10%” are getting richer all the time while “the bottom 10%” are staying stagnant, but what really matters is the ease with which people can climb up that ladder."

1987,sjrsimac,removecomment,2019-06-16 13:11:30,t1_er89j8n,"Short answer: There are many theories, but colonialism lie at the heart.

Long answer:  

Fore-Warning: What I've written below is very general. I've tried to give specific examples, but the topic extends literally across the entire world over hundreds of years. I strongly encourage you to further research the topic, in a more specific place and time.

To open, I'll just point out that 'Western Culture' and the idea of 'The West' is a modern concept and an extremely amorphous one at that. Latin American states are descended from European colonial endevours, just as the United States and Canada were yet generally only the latter are counted as 'The West'. Describing Picasso, DaVinci, Mendel and Einstein as each being a part of a broader 'Western Culture' is misleading. I recommend [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyaftqCORT4) video by Contrapoints if you're interested in a short history of the creation of the idea of 'The West'. 

But back on topic. Why is 'The West' richer than everywhere else? You can divide this question into two parts: 'why is the west rich?' and 'why is everywhere else poor?'

*Why is everyone else poor?*

In a word, colonialism. The colonisation of the globe by Europeans was a violent and highly disruptive affair, involving enormous quantities of bloodshed. This naturally led to the colonised population having far more limited opportunities to demonstrate their culture, and European colonists generally expected the colonised to integrate into metropolitan culture and identity as part of a moral and spiritual uplifitng, or 'civilising mission'. Lawrence James' *The Rise and Fall of the British Empire* describes an account of this occuring in the South Pacific, where missionaries made contact with native islanders: ""'the savage no sooner becomes ashamed of his nakedness, than the loom is ready to clothe him, the forge prepares for him more perfect tools' and so on until he is dependent on the artefacts and techniques of Europe"". The cultures of the colonised were suppressed and destroyed wherever possible, binding the colonised more deeply to the colonial system. This extended to economic affairs as well. Under British rule farmers in India were required to pay taxes in money, rather than in goods. This forced Indians into the British market structure and obliged them to raise cash crops for sale, rather than food crops for consumption. This has been identified as one of the contibuting causes of the Indian famines.  

Racism was deeply entrenched in this process. James' described how during the wars that led Britain to take control over the Indian sub-continent, the British public and government considered Indian rulers as unelightened despots in need of 'guidance' by Europeans. The colonised were expected to perform in a certain, subserviant role. African subjects of Britain could be soldiers, but not officers for example. James' describes how while the British government in India attempted to raise the literacy rate, access to higher education was deliberately restricted and left underdeveloped. Indians needed to study in London to receive a university degree, and the British government set limits on the number of Indians who could study at any one time. This phenemenon was repeated across the British Empire in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Oceania, leaving the colonised territories with few who had the training to govern and even fewer with practical experience in doing so. Following the end of colonialism during the second half of the 1900s the newly independent nations simply did not have the qualified personnel to run governments and develop economies. 

This led to a secondary factor that has stymied the development of poorer nations. Without a capital base in order to support their own development, due to the effects of colonialism, the newly independent nations often had little choice but to turn back to their former colonial master for aid and investment, which came with strings attached. For example during the interwar period Central American nations (who while never formally colonised by the United States existed within the American sphere of influence) who wanted American aid had to meet American policy goals. Nations that refused to were invaded and occupied, whereupon the American occupation would simply impose their policies on the country. Similarly West African nations were heavily reliant on French aid, and nations that were hostile to French interests (Such as Burkina Faso under Sankara) were undermined. 

Colonialism also affected matters through deliberate policies of divide and conquer. Colonial governments often deliberately stoked tensions between the various groups of the colonised in order to remain in ultimate control. Examples include French favouring of the Alawite minority in Syria, the British stressing relations between Hindus and Muslims in India and most infamously between Hutus and Tutsis in Belgian Rwanda. Upon independence these tensions erupted, causing coups, civil wars, wars, political unrest and genocide. All of which is not conductive to the creation of a productive and prosperous economy and society. 

All of this raises the question of why European nations were the only ones (excluding Japan) to build colonial empires, and is a controversial question. Some, like Jared Diamond of *Guns, Germs and Steel* infamy, suggest that the cause was geography. Small (at least in comparison to Empires like China) European states competed against each other protected by rivers and mountains, and this competition gave Europeans an edge. Others suggest that there is some factor that drove Europeans that did not drive others. Max Weber suggested that it was the 'Protestant Work Ethic' that gave Europeans an advantage. Others suggest that it was intra-European conflicts, in which armies needed powerful states to run and equip them and this advantage in state formation started the snowball effect. There isn't a clear answer.

It is also worth mentioning that non-western nations have also been prosperous historically. Prior to the industrial revolution China was the worlds largest economy, Japan independently created their own industrial economy and during the early parts of the 20th century Argentina had a GDP per capita *greater* than the United States. All of these 'non-western' nations were wealthy and powerful, to greater or lesser degrees. 

*Why is the 'The West' rich?*

This is a much tougher question, and one that I am less versed in. It is hard to put an exact dollar figure on how much colonisers benefitted from colonialism, but the amount is certainly huge. Colonised territories provided cheap materials to the metropole, but also created captive markets for metropolitan finished goods to be exported back into. Public works programs in colonised territories, paid for at least in part by taxes on colonial subjects, transferred great deals of money into the hands of coloniser business' which went back to the metropole. Soldiers raised from the colonies freed metropoltan manpower for economic development, as well as saved the coloniser government money given the lower rates of pay for colonial soldiers.

Colonialism also indirectly benefitted through creating groups in ex-colonial nations with deep ties to the metropole. For example leaders in French West Africa often studied in France, and upon independence maintained close relations with the French government. This allowed French business' to retain their predominant position in the markest of the ex-colonies, and to be the first port of call for investment. 

Apart from benefitting from colonialism, European and North American governments embraced free market economics and employed numerous pro-business and pro-competition policies. The United States, and to a lesser extent Canada and the EU, have large and seamless internal markets unhindered by barriers to trade. 

To sum:
> Why has western culture developed such progress while many of the other countries in Africa, Latin America and many eastern Asian countries? 

Because colonialism destroyed or tried to destroy alternative cultures, and got rich off of them.

> Can we blame that on western conquest of so many cultures? 

Yes, absolutely.

> But even so, how did western culture become rich and powerful enough to do that

No-one is quite sure, but there are many theories.

2000,AutoModerator,removecomment,2019-06-16 02:36:33,t1_eratjo3,"This is a complicated question for a variety of reasons, some of which are in-the-weeds related to issues of measurement.

Let’s start with an easy approach to thinking about this. What does the “bottom 10%” look like?  For the most part, the bottom 10% of wage-earners are high school/college kids and various minimum wage workers.  As it turns out, entry-level work of this sort of thing just doesn’t pay all that much, in part because there has (for a long time now) been an ever growing population of “new young people” willing to start their careers on this rung of the economic ladder, meaning the supply of low-skill labor has been increasing over time.  Some people argue that this is changing, citing decreasing high school enrollment as evidence of decreasing population growth. 

Another aspect of this is the recent influx of college grads taking these kinds of jobs, which only increases the supply of labor in the low-skill-labor market even more.  Why are so many college grads taking these jobs?  I have a lot of thoughts on this, but a lot of it can be summed up as “because higher education has become a shell of its former self.”  Today, an insane number of people go to college. But, and to put it bluntly, about half of college students probably shouldn’t be there to begin with.  This isn’t saying that they’re dumb or anything; it’s just that college isn’t really for them.  One of my best friends is one of these people.  He flunked out of college, found a job at a UPS store, got super into thinking about business and logistics, and now he owns the store he used to work at and is about to expand to buying a second store.  He’s pulling down somewhere around $180k about now, providing for his lovely kids and wife, and really enjoying life.  He works really hard, but he loves it.

Colleges don’t like it when people flunk out.  They lose not only the tuition that the person would pay, but oftentimes they lose out on state/federal subsidies for having a certain number of students.  This is especially true at smaller colleges.  At the school I work at, we had 20 students transfer between the fall and spring semesters.  This actually had a really big impact on our budget, and several offices had to make cuts to their budgets/not hire an additional worker.

One solution that a lot of colleges are (regrettably) taking is to water down the degree.  Gone are the days where knowing basic calculus is expected of all college grads.  A class called “college algebra” will do in most cases.  While this makes it easier for students to stay enrolled, it has the downside of arming them with fewer skills upon graduation.

As a result, college has become increasingly about 1) what school you went to and (relatedly) 2) who you met while you were in school and much, much less about 3) what you know and 4) what you studied.

EDIT:

I should also add a bit about why the wages of the top 10% have gone up so much relative to the bottom 10%, which have largely stagnated.

If you track individual people’s wages over time, you’ll find that, with very few exceptions (much fewer than you might be led to believe), wages go up every year.  In fact, every generation can reasonably expect to be about twice as wealthy *in real terms* (if you control for inflation properly, which is absurdly hard to do in the age of computers) as their parents.  This is fantastic.  So while everyone’s wages are going up over time as they continue to work, the people who are just starting out on their journeys are still starting at the low, entry level wage.

One image to help picture this is to think about those telescoping ladders that used to be sold on HSN back in the day.  The ladder only has a certain number of rungs on it.  When you compress the ladder down, all the rungs are really close together.  But when you extend the ladder, the bottom run stays exactly as high as it was (remains stagnant) while the top rung goes higher and higher.

When people divide the income distribution into deciles and then talk about how the top decile is getting higher and higher while the bottom decile is remaining stagnant, they’re basically talking about a collapsable ladder being extended.  So they’re right to point out that “the top 10%” are getting richer all the time while “the bottom 10%” are staying stagnant, but what really matters is the ease with which people can climb up that ladder."

2003,AutoModerator,removecomment,2019-06-16 00:19:29,t1_erahrms,"It's a complex question and you aren't going to find a single answer. One factor is simple lack of political will. The national minimum wage is actually lower today than it was in 1950. The GOP has held either the House or the Executive branch for all but 4 of the last 40 years, and they are convinced that minimum wage laws are bad.

Another factor is a large decease in worker unionization. There has been a pretty concerted effort on the part of corporate lobbyists to erode union power over the last 40 years. Setting aside the question of whether unions are good for the economy, they do at least give workers more negotiating power. Imagine if there was a powerful national Retail Workers Union that all retail workers belonged to. At the same time, both technology and globalization have completely changed the corporate climate and the national economy. Rather than increase wages, corporations tend to rely on automation and outsourcing. Instead of competing with a national pool of wage workers, you now have to compete with a global pool of wage workers.

Lastly, you can't overlook welfare as a factor that can pull people out of the workforce, although most data suggests it doesn't play as big of a role as right wingers tend to claim."

See Murmann's book:  https://www.amazon.com/Knowledge-Competitive-Advantage-Coevolution-Institutions/dp/0521684153

BASF, Merck, Bayer - all these companies emerged from the middle and late 1800s.   The book makes the point that the US had no similar kind of competition at the time.   Neither the US nor Great Britain formed competition to what Germany created in chemical engineering.

These companies are still functioning today. They and the universities  that created them formed a powerful wedge in their day, similar to what was created out of Fairchild, Intel, computer board manufacturers along with universities in the US.  At the time neither the US nor Great Britain formed competition to what Germany created in chemical engineering.  

Both have had huge impact. Murmann makes a point of discussing the networks created from university professors and companies involved in Germany. Murmann also discusses the synergy between universities, government, and business. There are similarities in what was once called the ""triple helix"" of cooperation between business, government, and universities in the US in modern times.

There is a more modern  book that compares Route 128 vs. Silicon Valley in the US.   The book called ""Regional Advantage"" by Anna Lee Saxenian, is described here: 

https://hbr.org/ideacast/2014/12/explaining-silicon-valleys-success.html 

Competitive advantage and knowledge appears to be able to function without a ""tariff"" like protectionist border.  If we follow the US from 1939 until recent history almost no protectionism was involved."

Where you want to take your career will be important to answering your question but as someone with a BS vs a BA vs a BSBA I can tell you my experience.

If you are looking for jobs in finance, the short answer is no it will not make a difference whether your degree is a BA or a BSBA, but you may find that you will have to justify your economics background to employers.  Despite the fact that finance and Economics are very similar fields of study (so much so that some schools combine the degrees) some positions will require a degree in finance or accounting and are quick to turn down job seekers because they don’t have the right field of study on their degree.  That said, I’ve personally had the experience where I was interviewed for a position in finance where the hiring manager said I was there because of my economics degree as she believed I’d probably have better computational skills and a better understanding of statistics than a finance major.  After a few years of good experience in your field, your bachelors will be weighted less and you’ll find you’re next positions will be based on your work experience.

>Now, if you've taken a Intermediate Macroeconomics class you understand that a large part of our balance of payments is made up by foreign investment

The reason for this is important to consider before moving on, as it ties into your later comments regarding the strong dollar. The United States currently has the largest current account deficit in the world. About -$490 billion dollars last year (UK was second highest deficit at only about -$120 billion). This means that the US has to borrow incredible amounts of money to keep their economy afloat because Americans buy more than they sell. They are able to do this because of the strong dollar that you mentioned. 

&nbsp;

A strong dollar is not necessarily good or bad, it depends on who you are in the economy and what kind of economy we are talking about. Are you a company/individual that imports products? A strong dollar lets you do more of that. Are you an exporter? Then your products are more expensive to foreign nations/consumers. Are you a US company selling products abroad in foreign currency? A strong dollar translates to less dollar revenue when you convert that foreign currency back to dollars. 

It is currently quite expensive to buy American goods as a foreign nation/person but American companies are very attractive to foreign investors - leading to a high capital account (among other reasons). 

&nbsp;

> What's stopping that foreign investment shifting to China when they are the premier economy?

Not much, to be honest, if China becomes the more attractive economy for foreign investments. If America's industry leaders were to suddenly pale in comparison to their Chinese counterparts with regards to technological innovation, quality, and profits, why would you not seek greater return for your investments abroad? I think this is a bit of a stretch for now, as America still has the benefit of having established industries

&nbsp;

>Well what's to say this would change as China begins to lead the world in the the coming decades?

I think a shift in foreign investment from US to China coupled with a weaker dollar would translate into a net increase in the US current account and a net decrease in the US capital account. However, if China's currency were to rise, all those cheap Chinese goods would become more expensive and Chinese exports would suffer.

The final savings glut is feeding developed countries across the world foreign investment. For example, the U.S. had a trade deficit of -2.3% of GDP in 2017. The U.K. also ran a deficit of -3.7% that year, as did Canada which hit -2.8% (via [WB WDI](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/BN.CAB.XOKA.GD.ZS?end=2017&start=1960&view=chart)), all of which had smaller economies than China. It's by no means impossible to finance a current account deficit as a developed country even without having the world's reserve currency.

Another thing to remember is that USD denominated debt is desirable because of the shared global belief that America is the most likely country to never default on its bills or having to deflate the hell out of it's currency to do so. If China becomes the world's biggest trading partner, that's a point in its favor. However, there are still some financial hangups which disadvantage it, including the lack of independence of the People's Bank and its large state-owned sector.

So, given all that IMO the U.S. government might have to be a little less cavalier with its deficits, but I doubt the country wouldn't have enough incoming savings to finance a current account surplus of similar size."

Strong house price growth under those conditions does not necessarily imply that a crash is coming. (But it also doesn't imply that a crash won't come.)

Mortgage defaults only happen when you cannot make the repayments. The bank will not want you to declare bankruptcy as a result of the collateral falling below the loan value - they would lose out of it. They lose nothing if you keep repaying. 

Think about whether you can and want to afford the repayments, taking into account the rent you'd save (or receive) from owning. This aspect could end up impacting you more than changes in the house's price.

The final savings glut is feeding developed countries across the world foreign investment. For example, the U.S. had a trade deficit of -2.3% of GDP in 2017. The U.K. also ran a deficit of -3.7% that year, as did Canada which hit -2.8% (via [WB WDI](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/BN.CAB.XOKA.GD.ZS?end=2017&start=1960&view=chart)), all of which had smaller economies than China. It's by no means impossible to finance a current account deficit as a developed country even without having the world's reserve currency.

Another thing to remember is that USD denominated debt is desirable because of the shared global belief that America is the most likely country to never default on its bills or having to deflate the hell out of it's currency to do so. If China becomes the world's biggest trading partner, that's a point in its favor. However, there are still some financial hangups which disadvantage it, including the lack of independence of the People's Bank and its large state-owned sector.

So, given all that IMO the U.S. government might have to be a little less cavalier with its deficits, but I doubt the country wouldn't have enough incoming savings to finance a current account surplus of similar size."

Long answer:  

Fore-Warning: What I've written below is very general. I've tried to give specific examples, but the topic extends literally across the entire world over hundreds of years. I strongly encourage you to further research the topic, in a more specific place and time.

To open, I'll just point out that 'Western Culture' and the idea of 'The West' is a modern concept and an extremely amorphous one at that. Latin American states are descended from European colonial endevours, just as the United States and Canada were yet generally only the latter are counted as 'The West'. Describing Picasso, DaVinci, Mendel and Einstein as each being a part of a broader 'Western Culture' is misleading. I recommend [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyaftqCORT4) video by Contrapoints if you're interested in a short history of the creation of the idea of 'The West'. 

But back on topic. Why is 'The West' richer than everywhere else? You can divide this question into two parts: 'why is the west rich?' and 'why is everywhere else poor?'

*Why is everyone else poor?*

In a word, colonialism. The colonisation of the globe by Europeans was a violent and highly disruptive affair, involving enormous quantities of bloodshed. This naturally led to the colonised population having far more limited opportunities to demonstrate their culture, and European colonists generally expected the colonised to integrate into metropolitan culture and identity as part of a moral and spiritual uplifitng, or 'civilising mission'. Lawrence James' *The Rise and Fall of the British Empire* describes an account of this occuring in the South Pacific, where missionaries made contact with native islanders: ""'the savage no sooner becomes ashamed of his nakedness, than the loom is ready to clothe him, the forge prepares for him more perfect tools' and so on until he is dependent on the artefacts and techniques of Europe"". The cultures of the colonised were suppressed and destroyed wherever possible, binding the colonised more deeply to the colonial system. This extended to economic affairs as well. Under British rule farmers in India were required to pay taxes in money, rather than in goods. This forced Indians into the British market structure and obliged them to raise cash crops for sale, rather than food crops for consumption. This has been identified as one of the contibuting causes of the Indian famines.  

Racism was deeply entrenched in this process. James' described how during the wars that led Britain to take control over the Indian sub-continent, the British public and government considered Indian rulers as unelightened despots in need of 'guidance' by Europeans. The colonised were expected to perform in a certain, subserviant role. African subjects of Britain could be soldiers, but not officers for example. James' describes how while the British government in India attempted to raise the literacy rate, access to higher education was deliberately restricted and left underdeveloped. Indians needed to study in London to receive a university degree, and the British government set limits on the number of Indians who could study at any one time. This phenemenon was repeated across the British Empire in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Oceania, leaving the colonised territories with few who had the training to govern and even fewer with practical experience in doing so. Following the end of colonialism during the second half of the 1900s the newly independent nations simply did not have the qualified personnel to run governments and develop economies. 

This led to a secondary factor that has stymied the development of poorer nations. Without a capital base in order to support their own development, due to the effects of colonialism, the newly independent nations often had little choice but to turn back to their former colonial master for aid and investment, which came with strings attached. For example during the interwar period Central American nations (who while never formally colonised by the United States existed within the American sphere of influence) who wanted American aid had to meet American policy goals. Nations that refused to were invaded and occupied, whereupon the American occupation would simply impose their policies on the country. Similarly West African nations were heavily reliant on French aid, and nations that were hostile to French interests (Such as Burkina Faso under Sankara) were undermined. 

Colonialism also affected matters through deliberate policies of divide and conquer. Colonial governments often deliberately stoked tensions between the various groups of the colonised in order to remain in ultimate control. Examples include French favouring of the Alawite minority in Syria, the British stressing relations between Hindus and Muslims in India and most infamously between Hutus and Tutsis in Belgian Rwanda. Upon independence these tensions erupted, causing coups, civil wars, wars, political unrest and genocide. All of which is not conductive to the creation of a productive and prosperous economy and society. 

All of this raises the question of why European nations were the only ones (excluding Japan) to build colonial empires, and is a controversial question. Some, like Jared Diamond of *Guns, Germs and Steel* infamy, suggest that the cause was geography. Small (at least in comparison to Empires like China) European states competed against each other protected by rivers and mountains, and this competition gave Europeans an edge. Others suggest that there is some factor that drove Europeans that did not drive others. Max Weber suggested that it was the 'Protestant Work Ethic' that gave Europeans an advantage. Others suggest that it was intra-European conflicts, in which armies needed powerful states to run and equip them and this advantage in state formation started the snowball effect. There isn't a clear answer.

It is also worth mentioning that non-western nations have also been prosperous historically. Prior to the industrial revolution China was the worlds largest economy, Japan independently created their own industrial economy and during the early parts of the 20th century Argentina had a GDP per capita *greater* than the United States. All of these 'non-western' nations were wealthy and powerful, to greater or lesser degrees. 

*Why is the 'The West' rich?*

This is a much tougher question, and one that I am less versed in. It is hard to put an exact dollar figure on how much colonisers benefitted from colonialism, but the amount is certainly huge. Colonised territories provided cheap materials to the metropole, but also created captive markets for metropolitan finished goods to be exported back into. Public works programs in colonised territories, paid for at least in part by taxes on colonial subjects, transferred great deals of money into the hands of coloniser business' which went back to the metropole. Soldiers raised from the colonies freed metropoltan manpower for economic development, as well as saved the coloniser government money given the lower rates of pay for colonial soldiers.

Colonialism also indirectly benefitted through creating groups in ex-colonial nations with deep ties to the metropole. For example leaders in French West Africa often studied in France, and upon independence maintained close relations with the French government. This allowed French business' to retain their predominant position in the markest of the ex-colonies, and to be the first port of call for investment. 

Apart from benefitting from colonialism, European and North American governments embraced free market economics and employed numerous pro-business and pro-competition policies. The United States, and to a lesser extent Canada and the EU, have large and seamless internal markets unhindered by barriers to trade. 

To sum:
> Why has western culture developed such progress while many of the other countries in Africa, Latin America and many eastern Asian countries? 

Because colonialism destroyed or tried to destroy alternative cultures, and got rich off of them.

> Can we blame that on western conquest of so many cultures? 

Yes, absolutely.

> But even so, how did western culture become rich and powerful enough to do that

No-one is quite sure, but there are many theories.

Mortgage defaults only happen when you cannot make the repayments. The bank will not want you to declare bankruptcy as a result of the collateral falling below the loan value - they would lose out of it. They lose nothing if you keep repaying. 

Think about whether you can and want to afford the repayments, taking into account the rent you'd save (or receive) from owning. This aspect could end up impacting you more than changes in the house's price.

It's usually better to not hold off waiting for a crash, unless there are signs it's a bubble. To me, 20% growth in one year would not be a strong sign on its own."

Her policies were based around short-term economic booms, with little consideration for the future.

[Inflation rates of the cost of basic goods and necessities](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-kingdom/inflation-cpi) was far above what we consider to be average nowadays.

This is arguably at least partially a result of her policies of privatisation. The water authorities in the UK were stopped from receiving any funding for capital and infrastructure projects under Thatcher, who then went on to use this as evidence of their lack of efficacy. She kept this issue away the public eye until after the 1987 election, after which she then quickly privatised the entire industry. This directly led to a massive increase in the water bills of the average person in the economy, estimated to be [40% since then](https://fullfact.org/economy/water-bills-privatisation/)

The economy was also significantly affected by her drastic weakening of Union power. This began with legislation passed early on in her tenure, but continued throughout all of it, primarily adding several layers of bureaucracy to the process, along with removal of many union powers of the time, results in Union membership plummeting. [Warning, pdf Download](https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CBP-7882/CBP-7882.pdf ). The UK miners strike in 1984 also contributed to this. It was violently disbanded by police, and the Union itself picked apart by legal structures because of this. 5 people died, and 8,000 people were charged with a crime.

""The strike in Yorkshire relied on a ballot from January 1981, in which 85.6% of the members voted to strike if any pit was threatened with closure on economic grounds... Mr Justice Nicholls ruled that the 1981 ballot result was ""too remote in time [with]... too much change in the branch membership of the Area since then for that ballot to be capable of justifying a call to strike action two and a half years later. Scargill referred to the ruling as ""another attempt by an unelected judge to interfere in the union's affairs."" He was fined £1,000 (paid by an anonymous businessman), and the NUM was fined £200,000. When the union refused to pay, an order was made to sequester the union's assets, but they had been transferred abroad""

Her right-to-buy policy is often lauded and one of her most favored policies, and indeed it did result in a short term increase in people directly owning their own property, and even a small scale reduction in property prices. However recent studies have shown that roughly 40% of these right-to-buy houses are now in the hands of private landlords profiteering off them. This scheme, along with her removal of funding for council houses, is directly attributable to the drastic rise in housing costs we have today. [Houses nowadays are on average, £242,000, in 1980 they were £24,000. A 10-fold rise.](https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/mortgageshome/article-2921526/House-prices-risen-6-9-year-1980-according-ONS.html).

China was socialist.  There absolutely are  hybrid systems.  No one at any point in history has ever had a “pure” system.  Thus when the USSR claimed to be socialist they in fact were as they were substantially closer to pure socialism than any other system.

This China under Mao and the USSR were socialist nations.  Your definition of capitalism is fundamentally flawed.  The existence of private ownership exists in other non-capitalist systems such as mercantilism.  The defining feature of capitalism is that private ownership and not the state drives the market.

The presence of a market, state-controlled or not, is the opposite of socialism. Capitalism is defined in virtue of the presence of private property.

GDP growth by the end of her tenure actually ended up [worse than at the start](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/db/Annual_U.K._GDP_Growth%2C_1948_to_2012_%28Thatcher%29_%28alt%29.png). Her policies were based around short-term economic booms, with little consideration for the future.

[Inflation rates of the cost of basic goods and necessities](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-kingdom/inflation-cpi) was far above what we consider to be average nowadays.

This is arguably at least partially a result of her policies of privatisation. The water authorities in the UK were stopped from receiving any funding for capital and infrastructure projects under Thatcher, who then went on to use this as evidence of their lack of efficacy. She kept this issue away the public eye until after the 1987 election, after which she then quickly privatised the entire industry. This directly led to a massive increase in the water bills of the average person in the economy, estimated to be [40% since then](https://fullfact.org/economy/water-bills-privatisation/)

The economy was also significantly affected by her drastic weakening of Union power. This began with legislation passed early on in her tenure, but continued throughout all of it, primarily adding several layers of bureaucracy to the process, along with removal of many union powers of the time, results in Union membership plummeting. [Warning, pdf Download](https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CBP-7882/CBP-7882.pdf ). The UK miners strike in 1984 also contributed to this. It was violently disbanded by police, and the Union itself picked apart by legal structures because of this. 5 people died, and 8,000 people were charged with a crime.

""The strike in Yorkshire relied on a ballot from January 1981, in which 85.6% of the members voted to strike if any pit was threatened with closure on economic grounds... Mr Justice Nicholls ruled that the 1981 ballot result was ""too remote in time [with]... too much change in the branch membership of the Area since then for that ballot to be capable of justifying a call to strike action two and a half years later. Scargill referred to the ruling as ""another attempt by an unelected judge to interfere in the union's affairs."" He was fined £1,000 (paid by an anonymous businessman), and the NUM was fined £200,000. When the union refused to pay, an order was made to sequester the union's assets, but they had been transferred abroad""

Her right-to-buy policy is often lauded and one of her most favored policies, and indeed it did result in a short term increase in people directly owning their own property, and even a small scale reduction in property prices. However recent studies have shown that roughly 40% of these right-to-buy houses are now in the hands of private landlords profiteering off them. This scheme, along with her removal of funding for council houses, is directly attributable to the drastic rise in housing costs we have today. [Houses nowadays are on average, £242,000, in 1980 they were £24,000. A 10-fold rise.](https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/mortgageshome/article-2921526/House-prices-risen-6-9-year-1980-according-ONS.html). By comparison, avg weekly wage is [£530 a week in 2019](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-kingdom/wages). Up around 4-5 fold from [1980, when they were £120](https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/adhocs/006810newearningssurveynesagegroupgrossweeklyandhourlyexcludingovertimedata) 

She also centralised powers by [dismantling local powers in major cities like London, Liverpool, Manchester](https://www.theguardian.com/local-government-network/2013/apr/09/local-government-margaret-thatcher-war-politics), primarily because they all had labour-led councils and had major disagreements with her cuts to local services and funding, resulting in [the Rates Cap Rebellion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate-capping_rebellion) 

I don't have quite enough time to go as in depth as I'd like to but I hope this comment helps you to learn about some of Thatcher policies and how they affected the nation."

2155,BainCapitalist,approvelink,2019-06-14 04:25:51,t3_bzwmpu,"So, I've always considered socialism(from my low education in economics) to be a system in which the owners, in some way, own the means of produciton.

So, at a bare minimum, all workers in a country must somehow ""own"" the institution for which they are employed. I am not even sure the actual wage structure is required by the ""socialism"" I learned. For example, the ""leader"" of the firm may take 80% of the profits, giving much less to the ""co-owners"" who joined the company after formation. So socialism doesn't require, from my knowledge ""equal control"".

But, people like Bernie Sanders and Martin Luther King seem to be very much on the edge. They may not fit this definition of socilaism, but still seem to be considered socialist(espeically MLK) in the academic circle. For example, please tell me if these descriptions of socialism(from an academic paper on King) are accurate.

""to specify the sense in which King's social thought was a form of democratic socialism, several distinctions must be made. First, I would distinguish between liberal democracy and social democracy. The former is individualistic and atomistic in its social ontology. It promotes a politics of self-interest. Its doctrine of rights is fundamentally negative: one's rights are to be left alone, to be free from imposition and encroachment by others. The latter, on the other hand, is solidaristic and relational in its basic social theory. It promotes a politics of participation. its doctrine of rights is affirmative: one's rights are to be empowered or enabled to find fulfillment within an encompassing community of fellow citizens. In their respective doctrines of rights, the former is primarily concerned with freedom of speech and association, whereas the latter is concerned, as well, with education, meaningful employment, and housing. King's orien­tation is with the latter, that of social democracy. 

econd, I would distinguish between state socialism and participatory socialism. Both are opposed to strictly private ownership and control of the means of production. But the former espouses a concentration of the control of productive and distributive processes in a centralized state bureaucracy and/or party organization. The latter, in contrast, opts for diverse forms of public control, including producer cooperatives and regional enterprise. 

Again, on an ontological level, I would distinguish between a materialist socialism and an idealist socialism. The former is represented in Friedrich Engels' ""dialectics of nature"" within which mind is a function of matter and its intrinsic principles of motion. The latter is expressed in various forms of religious socialism, e.g., Frederick Denison Maurice and Paul Tillich, within which configurations of the material structure of social existence are expressive of mind. King, as we shall note, had severe reservations bout state socialism and he vigorously opposed historical materialism. His socialism was idealist and pluralist, grounded ultimately in religious commitment. 

Moreover, we should note that socialism as a social theory, whatever its precise form, contains at least three dimensions. In social diagnosis, its key interpretive category is alienation or contradiction. In its theory of social change, it acknowledges the necessity of struggle between opposing forces, oppressor and oppressed, and identifies the oppressed as the primary agent of change. In classical Marxist socialism, that agent is the proletariat. In other forms of socialism, that role might be occupied by other classes of the oppressed, e.g., racial or sexual. Finally, in its social telos, it is directed toward the overcoming of alienation, toward the recon­ciliation of estranged groups, toward the formation of a new society of genuine mutuality permeating all its political and economic processes. In all three dimensions, economic relations are a dominant, though not necessarily sole, focus of attention. 

More profoundly, socialism as a cosmology assumes a principle of internal relations according to which individuals are never merely such, but find their significance in diverse forms of interaction with all other individuals. Each of these dimensions of socialist theory is manifest in King's work. In social diagnosis, for instance, he labels American society as schizo­phrenic; in social change, he repeatedly insists on the special agency of the black community, although often allies that community with the entire class of the poverty-stricken; in social telos, his constant theme is the ""beloved community."" Moreover, throughout all these dimensions, he identifies the economic factor as vital to, though not strictly determinative of, the dynamics of these relations. And permeating his writings, as an expression of his deepest religious-philosophical commitment, is his un­wavering insistence on interrelatedness of all peoples and communities. In short, in social theory and in cosmology, King's work manifests all the marks of a socialist orientation. ""

So what is the difference here between a ""socialist oreintation"" and a socialist? **Can someone who wants to keep the capitalist free market also be a socialist**?

Full article on King can be found here: https://www.docdroid.net/ioO3jVh/mlksocialist.pdf

It was written by Douglas Sturm--Professor Emeritus of Religion and Political Science, Bucknell University.

I am a political theory student myself, and I feel we don't really even get this deep into the issues in my classes(likely because it is more pure economic theory) but I am very interested on what I should read.

I've thought about going to a library and just getting all the textbooks they have and looking at different definitions of socialism--I suspect I'll find varying definitions based on time-period and author.


EDIT: Let me note that I think it is important to draw this distinciton ""what is socialism"" because of the nature of many debates on the issue where people say ""Socialist countries never work!"" then people say ""It wasn't real socialism!"", it seems to me the truth is somewhere in the middle. These countries might not have instituted socialism as we talk about it(the proletariat taking the means of production) but can they be considered socialist(and thus compared with other ""socialist"" theories) in any fruitful way?

Or is the whole ""capitalism vs socialism"" thing just 100% bullshit?"

====================

The price of Italian pasta and Asian noodles will differ based on your geographic location, primarily because of the trade agreements (or lack thereof) that your country has in place with other countries. Regional trade agreements and unions lower the cost of exports/imports by reducing barriers to trade. Most countries will have trade agreements in place with neighboring countries, which is likely why New Zealand has lower Asian noodle prices relative to Italian noodles.

As an anecdotal contrast, where I live spaghetti bolognese from a restaurant will cost EUR 9.95 while pad thai cost EUR 13.50 and it has a much to do with the fact that, as you can guess, my country and Italy are members of the same monetary union - the European Union. Costs are lower for spaghetti than pad thai because there are less barriers in place for the trade of Italian goods and services.

New Zealand has no such agreement in place with the EU but [does have a few trade agreements in place with their neighboring Asian countries](https://www.export.gov/article?id=New-Zealand-trade-agreements), including Thailand."

&#x200B;

Not all housing is equal or comparable.   The apartment market vs. the single family home market, for example.

&#x200B;

There are different types of subsidized housing. I can't tell if you are saying it just exists as extra housing in normal locations socioeconomically, or you are saying that normal apartments in expensive areas are going for cheaper than they should because of a  subsidy. 

Also, there is the traditional market model impact, but also some indirect and and less obvious consequences. 

in the first order the market model suggests that quantity demanded would exceed the quantity supplied. then, substitution and other things happen.   It is little different from any other subsidized good.   it may be that prices in certain thresholds may adjust, but the cost of higher end housing may not be directly impacted.

&#x200B;

Anecdotally or indirectly:

&#x200B;

people who live near subsidized housing have some higher costs (security, lost valuables, lost value of property, etc) because their 'neighbors' are not the most savory of individuals. it also generally impacts the value of nearby property (downward) by altering stats such as crime or school quality. These are important drivers in market value.

There would be the advantage of cheaper labor in the area allowing for more competition, but it is a net loss to the subsidizer (taxpayer) and net gain for the businesses that get cheaper labor than the market would otherwise supply.  Ime, the local labor is often not supplied by these folks which is one of the arguments for its existence. Instead, many just loaf around all day with no intention of work. There will be 3 to 5 people surviving on the income of a single person who often is on some kind of fixed income like SS.

Cost of housing at certain levels could drop in areas that subsidized people would have otherwise lived...since they are living elsewhere. Crime in those areas would drop, but i am unsure if it would later fill in the gap (not sure how that works).

I'm sure subsidized housing (section 8, etc) saves some people, especially kids, retirees and others that are needy, but many businesses and able bodied individuals are taking advantage of it.  It is padding their expenses as we put in 1 dollar and get a small fraction of that back to society in returned net value."

Similarly, this puts money holders in a position where they have incentive to hold onto money because it will be worth more in the future. This will cause further deflation, ad infinitum.

2282,whyrat,approvecomment,2019-06-12 01:05:09,t1_eqs9olf,"The idea behind most of today's income tax systems is that: 

1. income is supposed to be an indicator of ability since we can not observe ability directly we rely on income as a proxy
2. we want to have a progressive tax system in order to have a degree of redistribution, therefore we impose higher marginal tax rates on higher income

By switching from taxing income to taxing consumption you can not really observe and determine ability. If I buy a loaf of bread you can not determine my ""ability"" and therefore have to tax high and low ability people the same - you lose the ability to effectively redistribute. A second remark, let's say lower-income people consume a bigger share of their income, while richer people tend to save more. By taxing consumption you basically tax a bigger proportion of the income of poor people as compared to rich people. Also, take into account that higher luxury item taxes will potentially lower revenue from it since luxury goods tend to have a high income elasticity of demand.

Now, if you were like, I’m gonna leave UCI because college isn’t for me and I’m gonna start my own business, that’d be one thing. But CS mostly seems to be a field where an actual four year degree may actually help you more than going to one of those coding bootcamps, for example. So there’s something to be gained by staying at UCI. Going to CC requires an application to transfer if you want to continue beyond two years, and then you’d be applying as a dropout of UCI hoping to get into...UCI.

There can be a place for supporting domestic industries while they're growing into competitive global industries. However, if it's not done wisely you can end up with a lot of investment in the wrong industry, which the government would have to continue supporting forever because it's not something the US is positioned to be globally competitive in without subsidies.

USD

EUR - Euro

JPY - Japanese Yen

GBP - Pound Sterling

CNY - Chinese Yuan Renminbi

As of 2018 the top 3 make up ~87% of the world's currency reserves.

The main reason why the top 3 or really the top 2 are so dominant is because reserve currencies are benefitted by their dominance to better weather financial problems. And, oversimplifying, the selection process basically focuses on the underlying strength of the economy of the currency to determine financial risk as well as the stability for the currency itself. Put simply, instability and risk in an economy/currency is not good.

Circling back to Bitcoin/crypto, it displays none of the above traits, having no underlying economy and wild swings in its exchange rate. And in regards to the Chinese Yuan and economy they're still considered an emerging market with many risks and instabilities. 

It took years for the USD to overtake GBP well after the US economy outranked that of the UK. So if you're looking for who's currency will take over the USD, look for their economy to outpace that of the US and provide more stability."

2300,Cross_Keynesian,removecomment,2019-06-12 00:00:30,t1_epxskls,"Let's say the production function is some function Y=zF(K,L), where Y is output and z is total factor productivity, which is a multiplicative coefficient of the function F that includes some combination of Labour L and Capital K. Take that into per worker terms by dividing both sides by L so you have y=zf(k,1), where all lower case terms are just their upper case divided by L. Here we see that per worker output is affected by the amount of capital each worker has, increasing the term inside the f function, then that figure is multiplied by TFP z.

When it comes to studies on privatization, I would agree that it depends on the study. If output per worker y changes as a result of privatization, with the function in mind it could be due to a change in k or a change in z. Proponents of privatization may say that private businesses acting optimally can be more efficient. If this means that they are better able to select the optimal mix of capital and labour, or that private firms have easier access to capital with which to supply their labour, then this would mean privatizing firms should lead to an increase in little k, so output per worker increases because each worker has more capital to work with. If instead the private firm is claimed to be more efficient with things like management, access and utilization of technology, or a whole slew of other things, then it should be due to an increase in z.

If it's the former case and the study is pointing to the idea that private companies find it easier to obtain capital, there's really no surprise there. But if the latter is the case and the claim is that private firms are better at being productive and efficiently using their labour and capital, then a good study should be controlling for changes in capital, as to pose the question as ""what is the productive difference between a private and a non-private worker in the same industry with access to the same amount of capital?"". If the study is in particular interested in one part of productivity, then it should also be breaking z apart into its component parts (of which there are many that vary by industry) to control for other factors so the behaviour of the factors of interest can be observed.

So to answer the question as to why per employee is used, one of three possibilities exists: either measuring the change in capital per worker as a result of privatization is the point, or changes in per worker output is measured while holding captial to measure changes in TFP, or the study measures changes in TFP without controlling for capital in which case you'd be right and the data is confounded."

Economies, in theory, can be sustained indefinitely.  Economies often fail as a result of disruption,  usually supply disruption.  All of the hyperinflations of the last 100 years have been caused by some form of supply disruption.  That are lots of different reasons, usually war and corruption, but money, or more accurately the wild unfettered creation and spending of it, **aren't** responsible for modern hyperinflations (despite what most people beleive).

>For this question, I'd like to look at it from the perspective of there being no further major technological advancements, just because of the unforeseen ways it can affect the economy.

I'm not sure why you'd choose to eliminate this factor.  You're correct it has an impact and it's one you can't remove and expect to get an accurate answer to your question.  Case in point, in the US people in 1980 were 2.5x less productive than they are today and that has profound implications on the economy.

There's no reason to eliminate technology from your question as it's such an integral part of the question you've asked.

>Anyways, would inflation and forever increasing debt ever become a real problem?

Again, this question has to be put into the context of the real economy.  Inflation and debt are meaningless unless we know other economic factors like:

Is there an adequate supply of raw materials? Is there adequate (skilled) labor? Is there adequate land? Are there external factors limiting supply (environmental, conflict, rule of law, etc....?

Money exists in the systems we have today because of debt,  Without debt, money as we know it wouldn't exist.  So in fact, the answer is, the system cannot exist without debt, not the other way around!

Inflation is just a rise in the general price level.  It becomes a problem when wages (which are just the *price* for labor does not keep pace or exceed the price of everything else taken together.

For example, the buying power of a single dollar has declined by 95% since 1913, but wages have increased by 6600%.

I know that sounds excessive, but it's true.  So why don't we all feel rich?  Because of the sheer number of products that we need and want have also increased vastly in the same amount of time.  But this is necessary because there are only 100 million people in the US in 1913 and each person was probably 10-15 times less productive.  Today the population is 326 million and each person can, thanks to technology do 10-15 times more work.  If you think about it, in equal terms, the population of the US today is 326 million (of which about 200 million work), now multiply that times the increase in production (I'm just guessing, but let's say 10 times) that means 200 x 10= 2 billion.  That means that 200 million people today can do the equivalent of 2 billion people in 1913.  That means we need a LOT more money and lots more choices about what we can buy or lots of people would be unemployed.

>Also how would debts start working? Is it okay to have ever increasing amounts of debt between countries or would it be too damaging to carry so much debt?

To really understand this question you have to understand how and why other nations come to hold dollars of other nations.

There's no harm in it per-se, but if a nation is a net exporter and its economy turns around, there will no longer be a desire to hold large quantities of the dollars of the nations you've exported too.  This would result in capital influx and that will cause disruption and some discomfort as economies work to find equilibrium.

>And lastly how would we counteract any problems that could arise from any of this?

That's just too vague...

>Do all economies eventually need to collapse and be rebuilt like with more recent hyperinflation issues?

Not as a rule, but as I stated, hyperinflations are usually the result of supply disruption.  If a nation can maintain a supply of goods and services indefinitely, then I see no reason that imminent collapse need be a thing

But, The tariffs in this case are largely political. In the case of Mexico the end goal bring Mexico doing something to help reduce the number of illegal immigrants coming in the country. In terms of business, any businesses employing them might have a harder time, but places like farms and so on actually employ more seasonal laborers who have proper documentation etc so any affect on farming is probably much less of an impact than it’s made out to be

In the case of China the goal is to get them to “play fair” which means a lot of different things in different contexts. 

For example the Chinese are flooding the market with fake honey. Basically it’s mathematically impossible to produce as much honey as they do so most of it must contain at least some rice syrup or other fillers.  We put a 3x tariff on their honey and suddenly an almost identical amount of Honey comes out of Malaysia, Thailand, etc. so that specific tariff had little effect. 

The broader tariffs are also to stop them from stealing our IP. There are fighter jets in China that looo identical to our own. It’s been proven the Chinese government regularly employs hackers to steal US military and business secrets and then passes it off to Chinese businesses/military. In this case the idea is that Maybe through tariffs we can broadly penalize them into reducing these behaviors (again among others). Those behaviors cause US businesses to lose their competitive advantage in terms of IP

If there’s this much fraud coming from their government and businesses then potentially their economy might not be at the scale it’s reported to be so we might have a better than even chance of outlasting them in a Trade War

I'd expect that there are effects due to behavioral frictions. I don't know any studies that look at pay effects, but I know of a couple that look at welfare payments. For example, SNAP benefits pay out once a month, and you can see a lot of economic effects - stores raise prices after SNAP payments go out, people are hungrier at the end of the month.

Here's a good paper: https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/688074

> Does the timing and frequency of program benefits influence student school outcomes? The poor may be especially vulnerable to income scarcity at the end of welfare program benefit cycles. Such scarcity may strain other aspects of family life and exacerbate children’s behavior problems. We use data from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and school disciplinary records to compare the incidence of disciplinary infractions at the beginning and end of months among Chicago Public School students in grades 5–8 whose families did and did not receive SNAP. Controlling for student and school characteristics, our estimates show that student disciplinary infractions generally spike at the end of the month irrespective of SNAP receipt status. However, spikes are exacerbated among students who receive SNAP benefits. The within-month difference in disciplinary infractions for students in SNAP recipient families is 7 percentage points larger than for nonrecipients. These differences are particularly pronounced for males."

For one, it's not clearly written. And in my experience, writers who understand their subject will communicate it clearly. Writers who don't really understand their subject...that's when the writing becomes obscure. 

I clicked the link to the underlying data the writer is trying to summarize, but you can't actually see the study there. Just a quick summary, focusing on the effect of capital flight to tax havens. 

One caveat there: this is a definition of tax haven that somewhat confuses me. I'm not an expert here, but I know that here in the USA we have a huge problem of people avoiding taxes by sending money to tax havens overseas, using places like Bermuda or the Cayman Islands. So why would poor countries be using the US or London as tax havens? I'm not sure.

Moving on, the writer, Jason Hickel, says that ""by far"" the biggest problem is unrecorded capital flight, which mainly happens through ""trade misinvoicing."" Ok, that's just straight-up lying about your sales. Like selling a widget for $100 and declaring you sold it for $50, or selling 2 widgets and declaring you only sold 1. This cheats the local government out of sales tax, if it has any. It cheats one or more governments out of business tax. (Now, as Hickel says, you can also use trade misinvoicing to launder money, but that works the other way. You sell a widget for $50, and then declare you sold it for $100, making up the $50 with your illegal cash. So money laundering would actually be good for these counties' tax revenue.) 

But aside from lost tax revenue, I don't see any negative effect of ""capital flight"" here. It's a bit of a mystery what he means by this. My best guess is that he understands trade in the same foolish way that Trump does; that if you buy something, it's a loss. So if poor country X buys some mining equipment from Caterpillar, they receive the equipment and send us their money. I guess Mr. Hickel is calling that ""capital flight""?

Although the majority of economists would likely be comfortable describing protectionist policies generically as ""bad"" or ""harmful"" (*with the implied caveat that, like most economic phenomena, they can be more heterogeneous and context-dependent than Econ 101 textbooks might indicate - i.e. Company or Industry A might benefit from a policy that hurts the economy overall*), given the tremendous consensus within the field, some outside the economic mainstream (ex.

2371,BainCapitalist,approvecomment,2019-06-11 16:49:54,t1_eqqgdri,"For many firms renewables are not yet in a state where the variable costs are lower than using fossil fuels. Expect this to change when technology and productivity improves. For other firms variable costs may be lower, but the setup costs may be too high such that they negate the lifetime savings of switching.

Firms will switch if the Present Value cost of continuing to use fossil fuels (say, price Px every year in perpetuity, discounted by the real interest rate r, so Px divided by r) is greater than the PV cost of switching (Initial Investment I plus the cost of using renewables in perpetuity so Py/r)

Px/r>I+Py/r is the condition to switch.

Right now for many firms the above is not true, and will not become true until some combination of the below occurs:

Px increases (through increasing prices from increased scarcity or through Pigouvian taxes levied on fossil fuels)

I decreases (through improving technology reducing setup costs or government subsidies paying for some of I)

Py decreases (through the same means as decreasing I)

As productivity technology increases and fossil fuels become less publicly popular and more scarce, the conditions exist for technology to improve to drive the decrease in I or Py. I won’t speak to whether or not government should be subsidizing it, but what is clear is that if the goal is to ease the transition away from fossil fuels, fossil fuel industries should not be subsidized as that decreases Px, demanding more from the right side of the equation.

If the above inequality is true for firms that haven’t yet switched, then other reasons include simple lack of information (remember actors are guaranteed to behave rationally and optimally only when given perfect information), managerial/institutional lethargy and inertia (Change Management is a relevant field of study for this) or the firm benefits from some externality that would be lost or mitigated by switching, to a magnitude greater than the perceived benefit, (ex. The aforementioned fossil fuel subsidies, or if switching made the firm lose consumer perception of reliability or something like that)"

America and Germany were huge in terms of resources and population for their time. Resources like wheat, timber, iron, and coal (some of the major building blocks of early industrialization) were in such abundance that American and German industries were able to use the inputs in their own countries to grow, with said abundance granting absolute advantage in most things, and either comparative advantage for themselves or a mitigated comparative advantage in foreign countries.

It's common to issue two classes of stock to differentiate passive financial shareholders from active stakeholders. Passive shareholders can sue as a redress if things go wrong, and generally they have a legal entitlement to visibility in where the money is going. So commonly even with private companies the board will sit in some political equilibrium, commonly with no individual being a majority share when standing alone."

The model does not always/ever work. That is an important concept to keep in mind especially since the real world is very complicated. Unlike the model there is usually more than one good in an economy and with movement in wages or any other factor there will be investment changes, substitutions in demand, sticky prices, changes in technology, changes in government policy, competition, labor participation, new industry, etc. 

Maybe OP would like to consider this.

Even OP mentioned he 'spoke' to other sources and they agreed the problem is more complicated than what you posted.  There are many criticisms of the Solow model and...it is just a model with assumptions and simplifications. There are things to learn from it and from acknowledging its weaknesses. It is commonly used and in a general sense your conclusion is fine, but to present the conclusion you have drawn from it as fact and what the field of economics thinks is not very honest.

I was also shocked to find out that an entry-level retail worker made around $1,170 whereas in the country I live in, a worker might make $200 max (despite working longer hours)

Are you comparing items at PPP? Essentially, to compare across two different countries (even if they use the same currency), you have to know if $10 in one country can buy you the same basket of goods as $10 in another country. That's the basic ELI5 explanation of why PPP comparison is better than direct dollar-to-dollar comparison.


Ninja edit: 

>Singapore as comparison may not be fair as it might be one of the more developed countries ,even among developed countries.

Singapore is actually a great example. Google images for Singapore in 1950 vs Singapore today. It has developed so bloody fast, that there are lessons to take from that country on how other developing countries could improve."

Capitalism and Socialism are ideological principles, ones which are easy to describe in theory based on ideal conditions but harder to actually implement in real life based on those idealised principles. The weak link here is the human factor, an issue that is infinitely more complex than most people seem to acknowledge.

Neither Capitalism or Socialism, as per their idealised concepts have truly existed. All attempts have had their flaws, and often, the limiting factor is not outside forces but the weakness of the system that tries to implement it.

Socialism, for example, has never failed because it is a lesser system. Rather, socialism require all participants to contribute equally. This however in practice is extremely difficult, often not because people are lazy or recalcitrants. It is just hard to have a standardised productivity system in any meaningful capacity at a grand scale. The conditions in one area of the country is probably different from another; different people have different interpretation of how much productivity is sufficient, and the efficient allocation of resources (human, materials) is extremely difficult to do in the short run.

When these happen, often times, those in power then try to exert control by using more and more draconian means to try to right the system, which then leads to these kinds of nightmare socialist dictatorships. There is also the issue of individual greed, objectives, etc, but I posit these actually play less of a part in socialist ideology. Often, socialists, even those that ultimately end up being brutal dictators, start out with well meaning plans. Outside factors, say external influence can also play a part, but again, while this is indeed a factor to be mindful of, these should be seen one factor but not a primary factor in why socialism in its pure form has not worked anywhere.

Capitalism has its own set of problem. It may be that Capitalism is a slightly better system when put in practice but it has its own issues. Capitalism, if you were to boil it down is the belief that the market (and consequently the actors in those markets, ie the people) will adjust to changing conditions which will consequently lead to better outcomes. Each actor in the system acts in his/her best interest - with the belief that consequently the summation of these actions lead to a greater good for the whole. Its also rooted in the idea of efficient resource allocation, where people and resources are allowed to be moved and allocated to where is needed, and demand and supply will drive this allocation.

Of course, this actually works really well for the most part. However, resource allocation is still not magically easier in this system than it is in other systems. It is hard - for example, moving people to where there is a need is hard. There are also issues with this notion of what is good for the individual is good for the market. We know that this is not always the case. There is also the issue of individual choice and freewill. Even in a society that has full freedom to act, you may be constrained by resources, time, ability, skill, etc. That means you may have to make suboptimal decisions. This applies to both individuals and companies.

There is also the issue of one acting in the best interest of oneself. What is in the best interest of oneself now, may not be in the best interest of oneself in the future. This is a natural flaw in the human psyche, and its not something that an ideological system can predict.

I'll end by saying that we should not say that Capitalism or Socialism have failed. I think its important to note that these are ideological principles that should be used as a guide, with the best path somewhere in between. The best democracies in the world today don't fit into either one system neatly, and we shouldn't be held hostage by dogma that one is better than the other. Indeed in some cases, like the economy, a largely capitalist system may be ideal. In health however, most people would want to see some form of common principle for health support."

An good example is that [an iphone would cost $2000 to make in the US](https://fee.org/articles/a-made-in-america-iphone-would-cost-2-000-studies-show/).

In addition outsourcing allows for using [Comparative advantage](https://www.economicsonline.co.uk/Global_economics/Comparative_advantage.html) and therefore when firms do this they can increase total world production.

Finally employment there is no doubt that outsourcing increases unemployment in some sectors (although there loss is almost certainly more than cancelled out by the consumers gain) it might increase it in others, imagine a company outsources shoe production to mexico, they sell the shoes in america for dollars but must pay the mexicans with pesos so they need to buy pesos with dollars, increasing the demand for pesos. This causes the value of a peso to go up compared with the dollar, so one peso can now buy more dollars making buying goods from the US cheaper and so mexicans are likely to buy more goods from the US so US exports go up as well.

Warren instituting policies to stop these benificical affects are likely to bring about negative consequences. (Personally I think her first idea of exchange rate manipulation is the worst)."

1. Producers will still sell until Marginal
Cost equals Marginal Benefit, but this point will be lower in quantity than it otherwise would be. They will make less money as a result. 

2. All units of the good will be sold. Fewer consumers will be able to obtain the product. Stores will likely be sold out, and black market sales will likely result. 

3. Producers will engage in non-price discrimination. This means they will decide who to sell to based on factors other than how much the customer is willing and able to pay. These factors may be based on connections, race,  etc. 

4. The quality of the product may decrease to maintain profit margins. The best example of this is rent control, where there is a price ceiling on housing. Landlords will often do lesser maintenance on rent-controlled units than they otherwise would.

2525,MrDannyOcean,approvecomment,2019-06-09 17:48:56,t1_eqj7qbl,"Futures are derivatives, which are legal contracts where the value is based on an underlying asset. They do not grant ownership of the asset itself, but a claim to it based on various factors in the contract. Futures contracts will state when they can buy (or sell) the asset and at what price. 

Grain (and other crops) yields depend on weather factors that we can't control. A draught can wipe out a whole field, which would cause prices to skyrocket because there will be less grain to go around. Similarly, heavy rains may bring a strong yield which will cause prices to fall as there will be more grain for consumers. In this way, the prices of grain are rather volatile.

There is also a cost associated with transporting the grain. The grain is harvested in the farms but they have to be transported and delivered to the market which has a cost attached to it. When yields were high, farmers were known to burn their crop rather than sell them in the market because the costs of transporting the grain were too high compared to the price of the grain.

Derivatives were introduced to help lock in a price and assure the commodity would be delivered. Both parties benefited, and locking in the price well in advance of the yield helped reduce the volatility of the price as it was no longer attached to the weather but an agreement set by the two parties. In essence, the use of derivatives helps reduce the risk for the users.

Derivatives can also be used to exploit arbitrage opportunities. The Law of One Price states that if two assets have the same value, their prices must be the same. If you find yourself in the position where you see two identical commodities selling for different prices, it is certain they will eventually converge because of this law.

You can take advantage of that by buying the cheaper commodity along with an option to sell the commodity at a later, higher price when the prices have converged. At the same time, you can sell the more expensive commodity and buy an option to buy the commodity back at a later, lower price. The use of arbitrage strategies generally involves leverage because you'll normally have to borrow the money to buy the commodity in the first place.

Derivatives are useful in risk management, information recovery, market efficiency and have operational advantages but are also criticized for speculation and increasing systemic risk. The fact of the matter is that we can't predict the future and the use of derivatives does just that. Some compare it to gambling, and the leverage used in arbitrage opportunities can cause destabilization to the market when it becomes too high."

Futures are basically prepurchases (someone agrees to buy a product at a certain price at a certain date), and options are contracts that gives a buyer or seller an option, but not an obligation, to buy or sell a commodity at a certain price at a certain date. What forward contracts (especially options contracts) do is transfer volatility risk away from a certain risk-averse party (whether it's the buyer of a commodity (think a manufacturer or distributor), who wants assurance that they can purchase a commodity at a reasonably low price at a future date (to shield themselves from price increases of raw materials), or the seller (think a farmer, or a mining company), who wants assurance that they can sell a commodity at a reasonably high price at a future date (to shield themselves from gluts or price slumps)). Because the risk is transferred from more risk-averse parties to more risk-oriented parties, total utility is increased. 

Options contracts specifically can help to decrease price volatility, as speculators who previously bought an options contract can purchase a commodity at below market prices, and can turn around and sell a commodity at contemporary market prices (keeping the difference in price as revenue, earning a profit if arbitrage revenue exceeds what they purchased the options contract for); this would slow the rise in price of a certain commodity. Similarly, producers are able to sell at an above market price, which would help slow the fall in price of the commodity compared to if they had to sell at contemporary market prices.

In regard to short/long, that refers to the speculator's expectation of future prices, with a speculator taking a [long position](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_\(finance\)) expecting prices to rise, and with a speculator taking a [short position](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_\(finance\)) expecting prices to fall."

However, if it's not done wisely you can end up with a lot of investment in the wrong industry, which the government would have to continue supporting forever because it's not something the US is positioned to be globally competitive in without subsidies. The idea of subsidies is to help a promising industry out while it's still in its infancy, and then to stop subsidizing it when it has reached maturity."

When a company relocates to a poo country they most likely increase the wages of those in the poor country since they have to attract workers from other jobs this can help the poorest people in the poorest countries.

Thanks to competative pressures a lot of the cost reductions that come from using cheaper labour in other countries is passed on to US consumers. An good example is that [an iphone would cost $2000 to make in the US](https://fee.org/articles/a-made-in-america-iphone-would-cost-2-000-studies-show/).

In addition outsourcing allows for using [Comparative advantage](https://www.economicsonline.co.uk/Global_economics/Comparative_advantage.html) and therefore when firms do this they can increase total world production.

Finally employment there is no doubt that outsourcing increases unemployment in some sectors (although there loss is almost certainly more than cancelled out by the consumers gain) it might increase it in others, imagine a company outsources shoe production to mexico, they sell the shoes in america for dollars but must pay the mexicans with pesos so they need to buy pesos with dollars, increasing the demand for pesos. This causes the value of a peso to go up compared with the dollar, so one peso can now buy more dollars making buying goods from the US cheaper and so mexicans are likely to buy more goods from the US so US exports go up as well.

Warren instituting policies to stop these benificical affects are likely to bring about negative consequences. (Personally I think her first idea of exchange rate manipulation is the worst)."

2573,AutoModerator,removecomment,2019-06-08 18:42:10,t1_eqfe4wh,"Protectionism is not good economic policy. There’s a reason the United States doesn’t produce pencils and jeans, and it’s not because corporations hate America. 

America could produce pencils. America could potentially produce pencils better than Mexico. But no entrepreneurs decide to do that because it’s a better investment to put their capital into technology or service-based industries, and trade for pencils with Mexico because it’s a better investment for Mexican entrepreneurs to produce pencils there. We have a more advanced economy than Mexico and thus there’s more opportunity for innovation in tech & services in America than with manufacturing. In Mexico, it’s the other way around because they don’t have the capital necessary to create a big tech industry; people who graduate from universities in Mexico and wish to go into tech or create tech companies move to the United States, because there’s far more money and opportunity in the United States’s tech industry. This is the basic absolute/comparative advantage lesson taught in the first or second week in most microeconomics classes.

How would this plan affect the country? Prices of pencils and jeans produced by American corporations would rise, profits of American companies would decrease, and areas of the country which desperately need to transition out of a dependency on manufacturing into other industries would be setting back their much-needed recovery by as many years as the plan is in place. So, American people are hurt by rising prices, American corporations are hurt by decreasing profits, and American towns are hurt by lingering on an industry that doesn’t have money or opportunity in it, and merely putting a bandage on a deep economic wound. 

Someone else can handle her point about manipulating the value of the US dollar, I don’t know anything about how that works. 

Epilogue: protectionism is a very old idea, much older than the world’s current obsession with free-market capitalism. The world was poorer when protectionism was rampant. Trading and letting money flow where it wants makes the global economy more efficient and makes everyone richer"

If there are less dollars in the marked, people will be less inclined to trade them for the pound, as there is the same amount of buyers and fewer sellers. Therefor whoever needs to trade their pound for dollars would have to offer more pounds than they had to do before the shortage.

After all, while not the best terminology to use, a shortage indicates that more people demand something than the suppliers can (or more correctly in this case, are willing to) supply. 

The interesting part about this article is that it was done intentionally. The article doesn't say how, but the intention seems to be to crush the black marked. By making their currency ""less worth"" it will be less interesting for criminals to use the pound to buy dollars. If the pound and the dollar had a 1=1 relation beforehand, and it afterwards had a 0.5=1 relation in favour of the pound, the black marked would struggle to keep up supply, as it would be twice the price. 

In some cases this will spiral out of control. If people lose faith in the local currency because a downward trend, they might try to sell everything they have because they fear it will lose even more of it's worth in the future. F.exa. if you realised what was happening when the pound was 1/6.7 of the dollar, and bought 1 dollar, you would now have 34 pound as compared to 6.7, netting you a profit of 27.3 pounds."

It means that the economy is doing well compared to other nations. In that sense, it’s a competition between economies, not within economies.

The ranking is given by the IMD so we need to see how they define competitiveness. Under the IMD’s website:

>Country competitiveness refers to the ability of the government to generate prosperity for its people. There are several implications in this understanding of competitiveness. It implies that countries with high levels of competitiveness are able to better manage their economic and human capacities. In this context, the government has a great impact in the achievement of country competitiveness. For example, the level of regulation in a particular country may hinder the ability of a country to increase its competitiveness. The infrastructure also contributes to country competitiveness by providing the adequate context to improve the conditions related to competitiveness. From this understanding of country competitiveness, however, is clear that competitiveness goes beyond the economic performance of a given country.

In other words, the IMD believes that Singapore is currently the economy which is best able to utilise its population and generate wealth. There is supporting infrastructure, government policies, education training, and hundreds of other indicators to support continuous economic growth."

For one, it's not clearly written. And in my experience, writers who understand their subject will communicate it clearly. Writers who don't really understand their subject...that's when the writing becomes obscure. 

I clicked the link to the underlying data the writer is trying to summarize, but you can't actually see the study there. Just a quick summary, focusing on the effect of capital flight to tax havens. 

One caveat there: this is a definition of tax haven that somewhat confuses me. I'm not an expert here, but I know that here in the USA we have a huge problem of people avoiding taxes by sending money to tax havens overseas, using places like Bermuda or the Cayman Islands. So why would poor countries be using the US or London as tax havens? I'm not sure.

Moving on, the writer, Jason Hickel, says that ""by far"" the biggest problem is unrecorded capital flight, which mainly happens through ""trade misinvoicing."" Ok, that's just straight-up lying about your sales. Like selling a widget for $100 and declaring you sold it for $50, or selling 2 widgets and declaring you only sold 1. This cheats the local government out of sales tax, if it has any. It cheats one or more governments out of business tax. (Now, as Hickel says, you can also use trade misinvoicing to launder money, but that works the other way. You sell a widget for $50, and then declare you sold it for $100, making up the $50 with your illegal cash. So money laundering would actually be good for these counties' tax revenue.) 

But aside from lost tax revenue, I don't see any negative effect of ""capital flight"" here. It's a bit of a mystery what he means by this. My best guess is that he understands trade in the same foolish way that Trump does; that if you buy something, it's a loss. So if poor country X buys some mining equipment from Caterpillar, they receive the equipment and send us their money. I guess Mr. Hickel is calling that ""capital flight""? That's a dumb way to look at it, but it's also how our current President looks at it, so who knows."

I'd expect that there are effects due to behavioral frictions. I don't know any studies that look at pay effects, but I know of a couple that look at welfare payments. For example, SNAP benefits pay out once a month, and you can see a lot of economic effects - stores raise prices after SNAP payments go out, people are hungrier at the end of the month.

Here's a good paper: https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/688074

> Does the timing and frequency of program benefits influence student school outcomes? The poor may be especially vulnerable to income scarcity at the end of welfare program benefit cycles. Such scarcity may strain other aspects of family life and exacerbate children’s behavior problems. We use data from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and school disciplinary records to compare the incidence of disciplinary infractions at the beginning and end of months among Chicago Public School students in grades 5–8 whose families did and did not receive SNAP. Controlling for student and school characteristics, our estimates show that student disciplinary infractions generally spike at the end of the month irrespective of SNAP receipt status. However, spikes are exacerbated among students who receive SNAP benefits. The within-month difference in disciplinary infractions for students in SNAP recipient families is 7 percentage points larger than for nonrecipients. These differences are particularly pronounced for males."

An econ major in general can do data analysis, work in banking, politics, government, education. Really a huge variety of private and public sectors. I've even seen job openings for the CIA looking for economists with a bachelor's degree. 

For me personally, I was always interested in doing data work or being a junior researcher or assistant researcher with the FED when I first started my undergrad. The FED does hire undergrad students in their junior year as interns and individuals with just a bachelors degree, but many FED locations have requirements for coding (computer science). I don't have that, so I never tried even though it was and still is a dream of mine to work at the FED. I have my BS in econ and a minor in math and marketing. I just recently graduated, and have not started working. 

I'm more into econ as a science and being able to do research or even teach at a college level. If research beyond data analytics is something you have an interest in you will need a graduate degree. I'm currently very seriously looking into graduate programs at my alma matter. I know the teachers there in the department, and I became quite close with one in particular. He has already asked me if I want to go to grad school and take an assistance ship. 

Overall, get to know your teachers. Get to know staff at your school, and who ever is in charge in the department. Your school should have a job board, and may even have job fairs you should consider attending so you can learn about the type of businesses who are hiring in your area, and what type of work your area has a need for. You will want that help from the school to guide you on whatever path you're most interested in. My college had people in each department specifically designated to basically place students in internships, so maybe yours might have someone similar you can contact. Having a double major or a minor is helpful for econ, because it will help you to specialize your skill set since econ by itself can be quite broad."

An econ major in general can do data analysis, work in banking, politics, government, education. Really a huge variety of private and public sectors. I've even seen job openings for the CIA looking for economists with a bachelor's degree. 

For me personally, I was always interested in doing data work or being a junior researcher or assistant researcher with the FED when I first started my undergrad. The FED does hire undergrad students in their junior year as interns and individuals with just a bachelors degree, but many FED locations have requirements for coding (computer science). I don't have that, so I never tried even though it was and still is a dream of mine to work at the FED. I have my BS in econ and a minor in math and marketing. I just recently graduated, and have not started working. 

I'm more into econ as a science and being able to do research or even teach at a college level. If research beyond data analytics is something you have an interest in you will need a graduate degree. I'm currently very seriously looking into graduate programs at my alma matter. I know the teachers there in the department, and I became quite close with one in particular. He has already asked me if I want to go to grad school and take an assistance ship. 

Overall, get to know your teachers. Get to know staff at your school, and who ever is in charge in the department. Your school should have a job board, and may even have job fairs you should consider attending so you can learn about the type of businesses who are hiring in your area, and what type of work your area has a need for. You will want that help from the school to guide you on whatever path you're most interested in. My college had people in each department specifically designated to basically place students in internships, so maybe yours might have someone similar you can contact. Having a double major or a minor is helpful for econ, because it will help you to specialize your skill set since econ by itself can be quite broad."

Even then it might not be useful, for example a company might be privatized and they could drastically cut cost, dropping output but increasing margins per unit, which would mean decreasing output but increased efficiency, if this is the objective that’s good, but if you are producing a public good the benefit might originate from the access to whatever the service is.

Current top reserve currencies:

USD

EUR - Euro

JPY - Japanese Yen

GBP - Pound Sterling

CNY - Chinese Yuan Renminbi

As of 2018 the top 3 make up ~87% of the world's currency reserves.

The main reason why the top 3 or really the top 2 are so dominant is because reserve currencies are benefitted by their dominance to better weather financial problems. And, oversimplifying, the selection process basically focuses on the underlying strength of the economy of the currency to determine financial risk as well as the stability for the currency itself. Put simply, instability and risk in an economy/currency is not good.

Circling back to Bitcoin/crypto, it displays none of the above traits, having no underlying economy and wild swings in its exchange rate. And in regards to the Chinese Yuan and economy they're still considered an emerging market with many risks and instabilities. 

It took years for the USD to overtake GBP well after the US economy outranked that of the UK. So if you're looking for who's currency will take over the USD, look for their economy to outpace that of the US and provide more stability."

>the Chaebol system was not without its downsides either and contributed to the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997. By providing a capital market externality and moral hazards that gave ready sources of capital for loans that probably wouldn't have been made in a Western system, there wound up being not only a bubble in interest rates and a glut of non-performing loans but a mismatch of risk/reward that reduced competition, innovation etc. It was just a matter of time before the house of cards fell.

But, The tariffs in this case are largely political. In the case of Mexico the end goal bring Mexico doing something to help reduce the number of illegal immigrants coming in the country. In terms of business, any businesses employing them might have a harder time, but places like farms and so on actually employ more seasonal laborers who have proper documentation etc so any affect on farming is probably much less of an impact than it’s made out to be

In the case of China the goal is to get them to “play fair” which means a lot of different things in different contexts. 

For example the Chinese are flooding the market with fake honey. Basically it’s mathematically impossible to produce as much honey as they do so most of it must contain at least some rice syrup or other fillers.  We put a 3x tariff on their honey and suddenly an almost identical amount of Honey comes out of Malaysia, Thailand, etc. so that specific tariff had little effect. 

The broader tariffs are also to stop them from stealing our IP. There are fighter jets in China that looo identical to our own. It’s been proven the Chinese government regularly employs hackers to steal US military and business secrets and then passes it off to Chinese businesses/military. In this case the idea is that Maybe through tariffs we can broadly penalize them into reducing these behaviors (again among others). Those behaviors cause US businesses to lose their competitive advantage in terms of IP

>the Chaebol system was not without its downsides either and contributed to the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997. By providing a capital market externality and moral hazards that gave ready sources of capital for loans that probably wouldn't have been made in a Western system, there wound up being not only a bubble in interest rates and a glut of non-performing loans but a mismatch of risk/reward that reduced competition, innovation etc. It was just a matter of time before the house of cards fell.

In general, freeing up an economy tends to alleviate artificial barriers that were preventing prices from being competitive, allow more participation in the economy by participants from a population, and ideally, prevent anti-competitive practices and monopolies from forming within the market (something many countries struggle with when governments don't act against corruption). 

A few books I've read have commented on this but a succinct evaluation of this is found in Fareed Zakaria's book, *The Post-American World* In it he describes how for many reasons, formerly ""Third world"" countries have made significant strides in creating a successful middle class through the creation of freer markets: less centralized, more capitalist though each with their own unique characteristics. The book mainly discusses how the Chinese's approach to participation of the global market with it's odd couple Communist ruling party, and India's pull towards capitalism after the stagnation that occurred in more socialist centered approach in the 70s has led to larger middle class, the lifting of large amounts of the population above poverty, and with a diverse global economy, a more evening of the scales against America's classic heavy weight. It also has references to rising economies in several parts of the world.

Again, in general, freeing up the markets does seem to improve livelihoods for a populace, there are notable exceptions to these norms. The U.S.'s healthcare system for example is far from efficient, affordable, or easily accessible. There are many reasons for this, I suspect a large reason why includes how healthcare does not act under the same motivations and principles as most other markets, and as such perhaps shouldn't be treated as such. 

Speaking specifically regarding Hong Kong, there's data put out by the World Bank that suggests a large reason why povery is increasing there is because of cost of living and limited housing. Those factors alone are outpacing the gains made from an economically free market. I can't say what the solution should be for it as I'm not an expert in it, but it makes sense: Hong Kong is a small city-state (ish) area, acting near independelty from mainland chinese rule with a vastly different (Western) approach and participation on the global economy. It isn't gaining more land and it's population continues to grow. Real-estate development outpaces the demand and so housing prices continue to grow. It sounds like the government has attempted to provide public housing but has made insufficient progress on that front.

2751,AutoModerator,removecomment,2019-06-05 19:26:02,t1_eq3tjp2,">but is it possible to sustain for prolonged periods of time?

Economies, in theory, can be sustained indefinitely.  Economies often fail as a result of disruption,  usually supply disruption.  All of the hyperinflations of the last 100 years have been caused by some form of supply disruption.  That are lots of different reasons, usually war and corruption, but money, or more accurately the wild unfettered creation and spending of it, **aren't** responsible for modern hyperinflations (despite what most people beleive).

>For this question, I'd like to look at it from the perspective of there being no further major technological advancements, just because of the unforeseen ways it can affect the economy.

I'm not sure why you'd choose to eliminate this factor.  You're correct it has an impact and it's one you can't remove and expect to get an accurate answer to your question.  Case in point, in the US people in 1980 were 2.5x less productive than they are today and that has profound implications on the economy.

There's no reason to eliminate technology from your question as it's such an integral part of the question you've asked.

>Anyways, would inflation and forever increasing debt ever become a real problem?

Again, this question has to be put into the context of the real economy.  Inflation and debt are meaningless unless we know other economic factors like:

Is there an adequate supply of raw materials? Is there adequate (skilled) labor? Is there adequate land? Are there external factors limiting supply (environmental, conflict, rule of law, etc....?

Money exists in the systems we have today because of debt,  Without debt, money as we know it wouldn't exist.  So in fact, the answer is, the system cannot exist without debt, not the other way around!

Inflation is just a rise in the general price level.  It becomes a problem when wages (which are just the *price* for labor does not keep pace or exceed the price of everything else taken together.

For example, the buying power of a single dollar has declined by 95% since 1913, but wages have increased by 6600%.

I know that sounds excessive, but it's true.  So why don't we all feel rich?  Because of the sheer number of products that we need and want have also increased vastly in the same amount of time.  But this is necessary because there are only 100 million people in the US in 1913 and each person was probably 10-15 times less productive.  Today the population is 326 million and each person can, thanks to technology do 10-15 times more work.  If you think about it, in equal terms, the population of the US today is 326 million (of which about 200 million work), now multiply that times the increase in production (I'm just guessing, but let's say 10 times) that means 200 x 10= 2 billion.  That means that 200 million people today can do the equivalent of 2 billion people in 1913.  That means we need a LOT more money and lots more choices about what we can buy or lots of people would be unemployed.

>Also how would debts start working? Is it okay to have ever increasing amounts of debt between countries or would it be too damaging to carry so much debt?

To really understand this question you have to understand how and why other nations come to hold dollars of other nations.

There's no harm in it per-se, but if a nation is a net exporter and its economy turns around, there will no longer be a desire to hold large quantities of the dollars of the nations you've exported too.  This would result in capital influx and that will cause disruption and some discomfort as economies work to find equilibrium.

>And lastly how would we counteract any problems that could arise from any of this?

That's just too vague...

>Do all economies eventually need to collapse and be rebuilt like with more recent hyperinflation issues?

Not as a rule, but as I stated, hyperinflations are usually the result of supply disruption.  If a nation can maintain a supply of goods and services indefinitely, then I see no reason that imminent collapse need be a thing

The main drivers are the propriety of land or physical capital and also financial capital.  The opposite of this would be redistribution of well.

Much of the US situation was inherited from the way things worked in the old world.  The financial/land capital of the rich supported the labor of the poor.

Poor people who were numerous and needed income (maslow's needs) were attracted (tied in some cases) to the financial capital of the wealthy.  Most non-wealthy did not have enough (money or will) to start their own businesses. The wealthy were attracted to the productivity of labor capital.

Think of the rancher/farmer who is well-off and employs those who do not have their own land/equipment capital. Or, think of the factory owner who employs factory workers. To be a worker you might need a place to work, but who is going to pay for the startup?

In all cases there are many more laborers than wealthy capital owners.  In most cases laborers were and still are highly substitutable with other workers meaning they have less negotiating power.

Even then it might not be useful, for example a company might be privatized and they could drastically cut cost, dropping output but increasing margins per unit, which would mean decreasing output but increased efficiency, if this is the objective that’s good, but if you are producing a public good the benefit might originate from the access to whatever the service is.

Even if the take-home salary of a waiter is the same with tipping vs. with a higher regular salary, a tipping-based system imposes a greater psychological burden on the employee. For example, female employees put up with [sexual harrassment](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/03/11/business/tipping-sexual-harassment.html) for fear of [losing tips](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/18/business/restaurant-harassment-tipping.html). Also, anecdotally, working for tips involves a greater emotional labor than otherwise, both in terms of always having to give a little ""extra"" (rather than just acceptable/mediocre service) and in terms of increased uncertainty over income. These are nontrivial costs and (in my opinion) should not be taken lightly or dismissed in an analysis of the situation. So, for at least some workers, a tip-based system leaves them worse off than a salary-based system.

With the exception of some workers who serve mostly wealthy customers (where really big/interesting tips can sometimes happen), I suspect that if you had a choice between ""$10.45 / hr with no tipping expected"" and ""$10.45 including tips"", you'd see a fairly even split between those who choose the former and the latter.

This is a hard question to answer. Fascism was invented by a guy named Benito Mussolini. I can only discuss his brand of economics. In his work The Doctrine of Fascism, he specifically decried both socialism and liberalism. He disparaged socialism on the grounds that it decreased saving, and that saving was necessary for the creation of capital, which drove economic growth. He decried liberalism, although this was for political reasons, not economic. Seemingly paradoxically, he both noted that the class struggle was a problem and lauded the creative power of the free enterprise system. He was really all over the place. 

He and his party tried to enact a system called syndicalism, or corporatism. In this system, industries would form their own specific 'guilds,' through which they would negotiate with other guilds and the government. Little attempt was made to actually realize this proposed system. As time went on after his party came to power, what seemed to result was an increasing proportion of all contracts with large businesses were state contracts, most notably for arms and munitions. Whether this was a bona fide attempt to accomplish something on the hand of the government or simply a corruption of the system by corporations is not clear. This was accompanied by high tariffs for 'national pride.'This is different from socialism in that the corporations were not publicly owned, but there was a degree of state oversight. 

Mussolini was also a big fan of Keynes, and called one of his books 'a good introduction to fascist economics.' It was distinct from liberalism in that the goal of liberalism was not an end, but a means. The goal of fascism was not a means, but an end. Mussolini didn't particularly care very much about how this end was achieved, and said so explicitly.

Trains may be more energy efficient, but they are vastly less space efficient. Train travel not only occupies the space necessary to house the trains, but also the tracks on which they operate. This is a permanent use of space, which is also on the ground (valuable space). There's a premium to pay compared to airspace, since there are infinitely more things to use the space for. With air travel, when the planes are not being used, they occupy a smaller amount of space. Even during use, they occupy a smaller amount of space. And the space that they occupy during use has very different utility than the space that trains occupy all the time.

So yeah, trains may use energy more efficiently, but the economics seem to point to the fact that they use space absolutely terribly when compared to planes. When you buy a train ticket, you are also paying for the opportunity cost of using the land that the tracks are on.

To try to get some insight into my original question, I downloaded the data, found a linear fit and then calculated the impact of that linear efficiency gain on world energy consumption assuming 3% gdp growth from 2014-2214.

Mussolini was also a big fan of Keynes, and called one of his books 'a good introduction to fascist economics.' It was distinct from liberalism in that the goal of liberalism was not an end, but a means. The goal of fascism was not a means, but an end. Mussolini didn't particularly care very much about how this end was achieved, and said so explicitly.

2899,AutoModerator,removecomment,2019-06-04 00:54:25,t1_epxskls,"Let's say the production function is some function Y=zF(K,L), where Y is output and z is total factor productivity, which is a multiplicative coefficient of the function F that includes some combination of Labour L and Capital K. Take that into per worker terms by dividing both sides by L so you have y=zf(k,1), where all lower case terms are just their upper case divided by L. Here we see that per worker output is affected by the amount of capital each worker has, increasing the term inside the f function, then that figure is multiplied by TFP z.

When it comes to studies on privatization, I would agree that it depends on the study. If output per worker y changes as a result of privatization, with the function in mind it could be due to a change in k or a change in z. Proponents of privatization may say that private businesses acting optimally can be more efficient. If this means that they are better able to select the optimal mix of capital and labour, or that private firms have easier access to capital with which to supply their labour, then this would mean privatizing firms should lead to an increase in little k, so output per worker increases because each worker has more capital to work with. If instead the private firm is claimed to be more efficient with things like management, access and utilization of technology, or a whole slew of other things, then it should be due to an increase in z.

If it's the former case and the study is pointing to the idea that private companies find it easier to obtain capital, there's really no surprise there. But if the latter is the case and the claim is that private firms are better at being productive and efficiently using their labour and capital, then a good study should be controlling for changes in capital, as to pose the question as ""what is the productive difference between a private and a non-private worker in the same industry with access to the same amount of capital?"". If the study is in particular interested in one part of productivity, then it should also be breaking z apart into its component parts (of which there are many that vary by industry) to control for other factors so the behaviour of the factors of interest can be observed.

So to answer the question as to why per employee is used, one of three possibilities exists: either measuring the change in capital per worker as a result of privatization is the point, or changes in per worker output is measured while holding captial to measure changes in TFP, or the study measures changes in TFP without controlling for capital in which case you'd be right and the data is confounded."

Even if the take-home salary of a waiter is the same with tipping vs. with a higher regular salary, a tipping-based system imposes a greater psychological burden on the employee. For example, female employees put up with [sexual harrassment](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/03/11/business/tipping-sexual-harassment.html) for fear of [losing tips](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/18/business/restaurant-harassment-tipping.html). Also, anecdotally, working for tips involves a greater emotional labor than otherwise, both in terms of always having to give a little ""extra"" (rather than just acceptable/mediocre service) and in terms of increased uncertainty over income. These are nontrivial costs and (in my opinion) should not be taken lightly or dismissed in an analysis of the situation. So, for at least some workers, a tip-based system leaves them worse off than a salary-based system.

With the exception of some workers who serve mostly wealthy customers (where really big/interesting tips can sometimes happen), I suspect that if you had a choice between ""$10.45 / hr with no tipping expected"" and ""$10.45 including tips"", you'd see a fairly even split between those who choose the former and the latter. But I'd love to see a survey of service workers on this -- bartenders, waiters, taxi drivers, barbers/hairdressers, et al."

Generally speaking the implications would be worse service for maybe the same cost.  Menu prices will rise to account for the increase labor costs (already the largest portion of restaurant costs).  Service would degrade, because why would I as a server want to bust my ass?  My incentive is literally work hard enough not to get fired, and if I do get fired I'll just find another serving job, there are a plethora of them.

>People that support the tipping system often make the argument:

>“If you do good work, you get tipped well, and if you don’t, you get tipped poorly. This gives employees the incentive to perform well at their job.”

>However, I think it’s naive to assume that people are going to tip you well even if you do good work, considering that tips are optional. In my opinion, an employee shouldn’t be denied a livable wage just because people are assholes.

Theoretically this could happen, but in reality that's not how it works.  I was a server for ~5 years during college, and I found that I made substantially more money than comparable jobs like retail.  Those few times that a customer stiffs you is more than made up for by the customers who tip well.  I was in no way denied a livable wage due to a couple customers stiffing me on a tip.

>Also, If wages were increased employees would still have plenty of incentive to do a good job because managers could simply keep a closer eye on their employees’ performance and fire employees that are performing too poorly. European countries already do this and it seems to work, so why not do it in the US?

This is false.  If all server jobs pay the same, there's absolutely no incentive for me to do a good job.  My incentive is to work just hard enough to keep my job.  I wouldn't even want the ""good"" shifts anymore, because all shifts would be paid the same hourly rate.  The ""good"" shifts would be the slowest ones, lunches, and Mondays and Tuesdays.  If I get fired for poor performance, I'll just wheel across the shopping center to the next restaurant and get a job paying essentially the exact same amount.

>“A wage increase would be in vain because living expenses would go up.”

This isn't really true.  If we're speaking of a broad increase in the minimum wage across the entire labor market, then you could make that argument.  Increasing the minimum wage for food service workers would increase the cost of restaurant food, but it won't measurably impact the price of cars, washing machines, or other goods included in CoL analysis."

I've heard this argument, but it hardly holds up. [1](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Restaurant-tipping-and-service-quality-A-tenuous-Lynn/a0b913e981bf27d0c265ed91a88765f738c04ed1)

Waiters and waitresses made a median hourly wage of [10.47](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/food-preparation-and-serving/waiters-and-waitresses.htm) which is significantly higher than the federal minimum wage and about the same level as some of the higher state-side minimum wages (i.e. California). Point being - wages wouldn't necessarily go up, in total, and if they did it'd likely happen in a minimal way. 

Large increases in minimum wage or wages *can* lead to distortions, but that much is only accepted when it is done on a large scale and the increases are too high. Changing how waiters and waitresses get paid is unlikely to result in anything of the sort."

Generally speaking the implications would be worse service for maybe the same cost.  Menu prices will rise to account for the increase labor costs (already the largest portion of restaurant costs).  Service would degrade, because why would I as a server want to bust my ass?  My incentive is literally work hard enough not to get fired, and if I do get fired I'll just find another serving job, there are a plethora of them.

>People that support the tipping system often make the argument:

>“If you do good work, you get tipped well, and if you don’t, you get tipped poorly. This gives employees the incentive to perform well at their job.”

>However, I think it’s naive to assume that people are going to tip you well even if you do good work, considering that tips are optional. In my opinion, an employee shouldn’t be denied a livable wage just because people are assholes.

Theoretically this could happen, but in reality that's not how it works.  I was a server for ~5 years during college, and I found that I made substantially more money than comparable jobs like retail.  Those few times that a customer stiffs you is more than made up for by the customers who tip well.  I was in no way denied a livable wage due to a couple customers stiffing me on a tip.

>Also, If wages were increased employees would still have plenty of incentive to do a good job because managers could simply keep a closer eye on their employees’ performance and fire employees that are performing too poorly. European countries already do this and it seems to work, so why not do it in the US?

This is false.  If all server jobs pay the same, there's absolutely no incentive for me to do a good job.  My incentive is to work just hard enough to keep my job.  I wouldn't even want the ""good"" shifts anymore, because all shifts would be paid the same hourly rate.  The ""good"" shifts would be the slowest ones, lunches, and Mondays and Tuesdays.  If I get fired for poor performance, I'll just wheel across the shopping center to the next restaurant and get a job paying essentially the exact same amount.

>“A wage increase would be in vain because living expenses would go up.”

This isn't really true.  If we're speaking of a broad increase in the minimum wage across the entire labor market, then you could make that argument.  Increasing the minimum wage for food service workers would increase the cost of restaurant food, but it won't measurably impact the price of cars, washing machines, or other goods included in CoL analysis."

>“If you do good work, you get tipped well, and if you don’t, you get tipped poorly. This gives employees the incentive to perform well at their job.”

I've heard this argument, but it hardly holds up. [1](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Restaurant-tipping-and-service-quality-A-tenuous-Lynn/a0b913e981bf27d0c265ed91a88765f738c04ed1)

Waiters and waitresses made a median hourly wage of [10.47](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/food-preparation-and-serving/waiters-and-waitresses.htm) which is significantly higher than the federal minimum wage and about the same level as some of the higher state-side minimum wages (i.e. California). Point being - wages wouldn't necessarily go up, in total, and if they did it'd likely happen in a minimal way. 

Large increases in minimum wage or wages *can* lead to distortions, but that much is only accepted when it is done on a large scale and the increases are too high. Changing how waiters and waitresses get paid is unlikely to result in anything of the sort."

The point about doing good work and getting tipped well is only half of the benefit of doing good work.  I don't have any studies or anything to point you towards, but from 10 years of working as a tipped employee I will say that yes your tips do improve as you gain experience and learn how to responded to what people want in each situation.  But the other part is, the more experience you have the better you are at increasing cost per ticket, which ups your overall sales, and the better you get at taking more tables which also increases your sales.    People often think in high class places you make the most money, but I had a friend who worked at Hyde Park and they would let him have like two tables max and those tables would often sit all night, so if he got stiffed he would make way less than me.  I worked at TGI Fridays and could have a 6 table section and turn the whole section over 4-5 times in an evening.  Sometimes I would do $1,500 in sales on a Saturday and my friend would do like $500.  So there is certainly more to it than, you get better, you get better tips.

&#x200B;

The other point you make that I find odd, is you say you think you deserve a living wage, even if you are an asshole, but no one is making an asshole that can't be nice to people be a server or tipped employee.  Beyond that you say if we paid a fair wage and got rid of tipping, managers could monitor and fire under performers, which would undoubtable include your ""asshole"". So I fail to see how the crappy server is any better under this scenario.

Honestly most sit down restaurant servers make, on average considerably more than  minimum wage.  I think if you asked most tipped employees they would say they don't want the system changed, at least that is my anecdotal take on it.

There are some known problems with the system, that as an economic observer I find troubling.  Not the least of which is the ""honor system"" for reporting income. I will just say, I knew pretty much no one that claimed all of the tips they earned.  Beyond that there have certainly been abuses, like the local Ice Cream shops that hire young kids, put a Styrofoam cup in the window with ""tips"" written on it, and pay everyone $2.13 an hour because ""they can get tips"".   Either way under the current system, an employer is required to at least pay the Federal Minimum wage. So if work an 8 hour shift and make $24 in tips, I got $3 an hour tips and $2.13 an hour salary, technically my employer would have to fill the gap between the 5.13 an hour I made and the federal minimum wage.

&#x200B;

To address your final comment about corporations lining their pockets.  What I will say to that is that the Restaurant industry is highly competitive, fickle, and relatively capital intensive.  Many places are already running 50-70% at current labor and food costs and that is before repairs, maintenance, rent, overhead, management, advertising etc.  Silly things like a jump in tomato prices can cause price increases, so increasing burden to the company would assuredly either be passed on to the consumer or the restaurant would be forced to absorbed the costs and almost assuredly fold (which would happen would depend on the elasticity of demand for each individual firm)."

Not all housing is equal or comparable.   The apartment market vs. the single family home market, for example.

&#x200B;

There are different types of subsidized housing. I can't tell if you are saying it just exists as extra housing in normal locations socioeconomically, or you are saying that normal apartments in expensive areas are going for cheaper than they should because of a  subsidy. 

Also, there is the traditional market model impact, but also some indirect and and less obvious consequences. 

in the first order the market model suggests that quantity demanded would exceed the quantity supplied. then, substitution and other things happen.   It is little different from any other subsidized good.   it may be that prices in certain thresholds may adjust, but the cost of higher end housing may not be directly impacted.

&#x200B;

Anecdotally or indirectly:

&#x200B;

people who live near subsidized housing have some higher costs (security, lost valuables, lost value of property, etc) because their 'neighbors' are not the most savory of individuals. it also generally impacts the value of nearby property (downward) by altering stats such as crime or school quality. These are important drivers in market value.

There would be the advantage of cheaper labor in the area allowing for more competition, but it is a net loss to the subsidizer (taxpayer) and net gain for the businesses that get cheaper labor than the market would otherwise supply.  Ime, the local labor is often not supplied by these folks which is one of the arguments for its existence. Instead, many just loaf around all day with no intention of work. There will be 3 to 5 people surviving on the income of a single person who often is on some kind of fixed income like SS.

Cost of housing at certain levels could drop in areas that subsidized people would have otherwise lived...since they are living elsewhere. Crime in those areas would drop, but i am unsure if it would later fill in the gap (not sure how that works).

I'm sure subsidized housing (section 8, etc) saves some people, especially kids, retirees and others that are needy, but many businesses and able bodied individuals are taking advantage of it.  It is padding their expenses as we put in 1 dollar and get a small fraction of that back to society in returned net value."

The 'answer' is devision of labour. The more people there are, the more specialists can be supported by demand. It's rare to find, for example, a full time ear nose and throat specialist in a small village, but they are relatively easy to locate in an industrialized countries' city.

This combines with innovation to allow some of those specialists to focus on, say, crop rotation, designing different types of fertilizer, automating harvesters, etc, thus avoiding the 'cliff edge' of a population that can't support itself.

The risk is still hypothetically there, but as demand grows, there is a natural, literal demand, for new innovations in supply (in a relatively free economy).  


Edit: Quick addition -- in a well functioning market (where price signals moderately accurately reflect demand and supply) it's theoretically impossible to run out of a resource. The price will just go up and up until the sort after goods / services are collectors items. It's also no coincidence that very rare items tend to be sold and bought via auction, as an auction is the 'fairest' (if one of the more costly in terms of time and space demands) ways to ascertain the 'real' price a very rare good is worth.   


This might not help much if everything needs food and food is rare, but those elements of capital which go into food production, in a theoretically well function market, are protected from getting 'hoarded' or 'not created enough' by the price mechanism."

It is very easy to compute absolute upper limits to the amount of population that can be sustained by the planet, also known as ""carrying capacity"". Take the amount of solar radiation hitting the surface of the earth, multiply it by an efficiency factor (plant productivity, Carnot cycle), and divide it by 2000 kcal. That is an upper limit on the number of human beings that can be fed sustainably on planet Earth. You can refine this calculations in a couple ways:

1. The actual number is obviously going to be substantially lower than that, for many reasons. For starters, humans need energy for all sorts of things besides eating. In addition, a planet in which all of the energy coming from the Sun is converted exclusively into human consumption would not work from an ecological point of view. I guess you probably need to cut a few orders of magnitude from that number.

2. For a limited period of time, humanity can overshoot the sustainable number by using nonrenewable resources, and converting energy from fossil hydrocarbons and fissile materials into e.g. food --- this is something we are already doing with fertilisers."

The 'answer' is devision of labour. The more people there are, the more specialists can be supported by demand. It's rare to find, for example, a full time ear nose and throat specialist in a small village, but they are relatively easy to locate in an industrialized countries' city.

This combines with innovation to allow some of those specialists to focus on, say, crop rotation, designing different types of fertilizer, automating harvesters, etc, thus avoiding the 'cliff edge' of a population that can't support itself.

The risk is still hypothetically there, but as demand grows, there is a natural, literal demand, for new innovations in supply (in a relatively free economy).  


Edit: Quick addition -- in a well functioning market (where price signals moderately accurately reflect demand and supply) it's theoretically impossible to run out of a resource. The price will just go up and up until the sort after goods / services are collectors items. It's also no coincidence that very rare items tend to be sold and bought via auction, as an auction is the 'fairest' (if one of the more costly in terms of time and space demands) ways to ascertain the 'real' price a very rare good is worth.   


This might not help much if everything needs food and food is rare, but those elements of capital which go into food production, in a theoretically well function market, are protected from getting 'hoarded' or 'not created enough' by the price mechanism."

Let wealth benefit all of society and not only a few, and behold the fact that reproduction rates will drop.

Wealth inequality (non-weighted average) has grown and reproduction rates have dropped.

>The common cases of India, China and Ireland do not represent a confirmation of Malthus, since the poverty of old times in those countries was due to tyranny and unjust government policy, where peasants were robbed of the product of their labor by thieves, bandits and absentee landlords. This will be true in all cases examined. Never has population growth caused poverty. For example in Ireland, poverty was just as large with a population of 2 million as when it had 8 million people.

In the words of Walter Block, that's unfalsifiable. We cannot know the poverty of Ireland had it *not* grown to 8 million. Multiple variables!

>Wealth is greatest where population most presses against subsistence, i.e. in developed countries. Wealth is determined by efficiency of labor, not generosity of nature. 

The environment affects human evolution and development.

>An increase of population actually makes it easier to support the inhabitants of a country, because the fall in the natural factor of wealth is more than compensated by the increase in the human factor. 20 people working a field where nature is ungenerous will produce more than 20 times more than 1 person where nature is plentiful. All of this without taking into account technological innovation.

Without technological innovation, 1 person will work on the most plentiful land. With 20 people, only 1 person can work on the most plentiful land, and the other 19 people, in decreasing order, have to work the more and more marginal land."

First, it's important to understand the current and capital accounts of a country. The current account is what's commonly known as the trade balance, or exports minus imports. The capital account is incoming financial investment minus outgoing financial investment. When trade occurs, a domestic buyer must trade domestic currency for foreign currency to buy foreign goods and vice versa. When trade is perfectly balanced, the currency put forward by domestic buyers will be matched exactly buy the currency put forward by foreign buyers. If trade is unbalanced however, say there's a domestic trade deficit, then less currency is being put forward by foreign buyers than domestic ones. In this case, domestic buyers must on net borrow from foreign lenders to obtain the necessary amount of foreign currency, so the capital account becomes positive.

Checking the country's current account, Sudan was running a trade deficit at this point. As such, it needed foreign investment to finance its imports. However, from the sound of the article, Sudan was having a hard time eliciting foreign lending (investment). Hence the dollar shortage. As dollars became more scarce, their relative price in pounds increased."
2987,Serialk,approvecomment,2019-06-03 13:20:59,t1_epvjcny,"Probably better to ask this to r/econhw. That being said, let's try to understand this with a simple example, rock paper scissors (RPS).

First, to describe a game, you need three elements:

1. Players
2. Actions
3. Payoffs

The big novelty, compared to the rest of your intermediate micro (basically consumers, firms and competitive equilirbium), is that the payoff of each player depends on the action of all the payers involved.

In the game of RPS, there are two players,and each player has three actions: R, P or S. There are 9 possible outcomes: player 1 plays R and player 2 plays R, which we denote by (R,R), P1 plays R and P2 plays P, denoted by (R,P), and also (R,S), (P,R), (P,P), (P,S), (S,R), (S,P), and (S,S). Suppose that the player who loses the game gives one dollar to the other, then the payoffs are u1(R,R) = 0, u1(R,P) = -1, u1(R,S)= +1, etc... So that's for the setup.

A pure strategy is simply an action in that case: tell me if you are going to play R, P or S.

A mixed strategy consists in choosing your action randomly. For example you generate a random number between 0 and 1 in Excel according to the uniform distribution and decide that you will play R if the number is below 0.33, P if its between 0.33 and 0.66, and S if its above 0.66. In this mixed strategy, you have a probability 1/3 of choosing each action, so we write this mixed strategy as (1/3, 1/3, 1/3). The first number corresponds to the probability of choosing R, the second of choosing P, and the third of choosing S. So in choosing a mixed strategy, you choose a probability distribution over the set of your available actions.

So where is the difficulty in choosing what to do? The difficulty is that your payoff will depend on what the other does. So you have to form some belief about what the other does, and then choose the best thing you can do according to this belief. For example if you believe with certainty that the other guy plays R, you would want to play P. If you believe with certainty that the other guy plays P, you would want to play S, etc...

Now imagine that whatever your belief about what the other guy will do, you always want to play one particular action. We would say that that action is strictly dominant. That is, it's better than all your other action, no matter what the other guy does. Life would be simple if you had such an action available, since you wouldn't have to think about what the other guy might do. You would just play your dominant action without worrying. This is obviously not the case in RPS. For a game that you can solve using dominant strategies, see the Prisonner's Dilemma.

Ok so now it's time to introduce the concept of Nash equilibrium. A Nash equilibrium is simply a stable outcome of the game. A situation from which no one wants to deviate, independently of others. So if (a1\*, a2\*) is a Nash equilibrium, then the utility of P1 from this outcome is better than the utility from any other outcome in which P2 plays a2\*: u1(a1\*, a2\*) >= u1(a1, a2\*) for all actions a1. Same for P2. Basically, you start at  (a1\*, a2\*) and go ask P1: ""are you happy this way, or do you want to change your action?"" If we have a Nash equilibrium, P1 would answer that they are happy this way. Then you ask the same question to P2 and they would answer the same thing.

A point of caution. Suppose you ask both players together whether they want to change the outcome, by jointly deciding what to do. Then they could say they want to change the outcome, even when at a Nash equilibrium. That is, Nash equilibrium is not stable under joint deviations, just under unilateral deviations. Again, see the Prisonner's Dilemma.

So, is there a stable outcome in RPS? Not if we limit ourselves to pure startegies. For example if the outcome is (R,P), then P1 is the loser, and has an incentive to change his action to S. If the outcome is (P,P), any player would have an incentive to change their action to S. And this goes on for every possible outcome of the game.

What about mixed strategies. Well a mixed strategy equilibrium has the same intuition: it's a pair of strategies that is stable. Now fix the strategy of player 2, say (p, q, 1-p-q). Why would P1 ever want to randomize? For example, if p is very high, that is if P2 is very likely to play R, then surely P1 would prefer to play P rather than randomize. Similarly, if p and q were very low, then P2 would be very likely to play S. So P1 should play R. So when is P1 ok with randomizing? When he doesn't care. That is, when all his actions give him the same expected payoff. Calculate the expected payoff of P1 from each of his three actions, given the strategy of P2, and find the condition under which they are equal. That's the indifference condition of P1, and it gives you the only mixed strategy of P2 for which P1 is willing to randomize. Now do the same thing but for P2. Then you have a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium. (Note that behind this indifference condition lies the linearity of the expected utility with respect to probabilities.)"

For one thing, many of the things that tariffs will be placed on have razor thin margins, so if they pay a 5%, they will be FORCED to raise prices, otherwise they won’t be able to make a profit. A 25% tariff would dramatically increase the costs of exporting to the US.

But let’s say, for a moment, that doesn’t happen. Let’s say the angry white man is right and prices aren’t increased. The tariff would still hurt consumers in the long run because it’s still artificially propping up domestic companies which probably couldn’t exist without tariffs, and is hurting the efficiency of companies that could provide consumers with cheaper goods.

If there are less dollars in the marked, people will be less inclined to trade them for the pound, as there is the same amount of buyers and fewer sellers. Therefor whoever needs to trade their pound for dollars would have to offer more pounds than they had to do before the shortage.

After all, while not the best terminology to use, a shortage indicates that more people demand something than the suppliers can (or more correctly in this case, are willing to) supply. 

The interesting part about this article is that it was done intentionally. The article doesn't say how, but the intention seems to be to crush the black marked. By making their currency ""less worth"" it will be less interesting for criminals to use the pound to buy dollars. If the pound and the dollar had a 1=1 relation beforehand, and it afterwards had a 0.5=1 relation in favour of the pound, the black marked would struggle to keep up supply, as it would be twice the price. 

In some cases this will spiral out of control. If people lose faith in the local currency because a downward trend, they might try to sell everything they have because they fear it will lose even more of it's worth in the future. F.exa. if you realised what was happening when the pound was 1/6.7 of the dollar, and bought 1 dollar, you would now have 34 pound as compared to 6.7, netting you a profit of 27.3 pounds."
