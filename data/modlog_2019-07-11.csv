Low-skilled workers have basically no market power, because the employer can easily find new people to fill the same job.  You can think of the low-skilled workers competing a la Bertrand, with other workers being perfect or almost perfect substitutes.  Even if there are many employers for a low-skilled job, the low-skilled workers are essentially price takers -- if a low-skilled worker holds out for $16 an hour instead of $15, the employer can easily replace this worker with someone who accepts the $15.

For microchip designers, skilled programmers, surgeons, etc -- these professions have more ability to command a high wage, in part because it's hard to find another person to do the job.  If there are three large hospitals in Cleveland, and the smallest of the three is trying to hire a spine neurosurgeon who is willing to take the job, will do it well, works well with the team, etc -- it's not trivial to find another such person who is equally good.  The hospital will decide whether to offer this surgeon a job, then the surgeon and the hospital negotiate the surgeon's wages.  Neither side is a price taker, so a [bargaining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bargaining_problem) model would be a better fit than a monopsony model.

One possible explanation from classical theory is that the producer still has to cover costs if demand decreases and so raises price.  This only really works though if the producer has pricing power like in a monopoly.  It would also tend to require fairly inelastic demand for output to stay the same at the increased price, a lack of suitable substitutes etc.

What you're discussing might come more from behavioral economics and the concept of [perceived value](https://www.celent.com/insights/430083255).

53,AutoModerator,removecomment,2019-07-10 18:40:43,t1_etg578y,"I think the two are intertwined. Computer chips and other electronics going down in price is largely a result of engineers gaining experience in the manufacture in electronic components combined with economies of scale as production quantities increase. You see similar things happen in other industries like textiles and farming, as engineers continually innovate newer, quicker, cheaper machines. If everyone in a market is continually upgrading, than the market leans towards price rather than qualitative competition - leading to commoditization and lower prices for consumers.

On the flip side, cheaper electronic chips and computing power has made made workers more productive. Another way of thinking about this is the opportunity cost of an hour of labor relative to other goods that can be produced. If cheaper computing power and automation has led to a single manufacturing employee to increase the value of their time from 10 chips an hour to 30 chips an hour, the ratio of manufacturing goods to service goods that can be produced in a single employee hour goes up - so in essence the cost of things like teachers, doctors, lawyers, scientists goes up in terms of computer chips. Because the input chain of drugs are the result of education, scientific research, doctors and lawyers all coming together to put a product on the market - all of these jobs have been relatively resistant to automation, the cost of labor for drugs has gone up significantly relative to computer chips.

Another important factor might be winner-take-all effects in both markets. Computer chips, in a relatively competitive market that competes on price have been incentivized to cut costs in order to avoid being outcompeted by others. Drug companies, who exist in a market in which only the newest, best drug is prescribed - are incentivized to put out the best possible product they can - regardless of price."

American race gap:

 [https://www.sociologicalscience.com/download/vol-5/march/SocSci\_v5\_182to205.pdf](https://www.sociologicalscience.com/download/vol-5/march/SocSci_v5_182to205.pdf) 

But its a very complex issue on both ends and depends on how you define ""wealth gap."" The breakdown of income class by race is here:

 [https://www.brookings.edu/blog/social-mobility-memos/2018/02/27/the-middle-class-is-becoming-race-plural-just-like-the-rest-of-america/](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/social-mobility-memos/2018/02/27/the-middle-class-is-becoming-race-plural-just-like-the-rest-of-america/) 

But if you take away race and plot just distribution of wealth you can see that the top 1% in America owns the same amount of wealth as the next 9% below them, while the rest of the 90% is dropping significantly in wealth owned.

 [https://equitablegrowth.org/the-distribution-of-wealth-in-the-united-states-and-implications-for-a-net-worth-tax/](https://equitablegrowth.org/the-distribution-of-wealth-in-the-united-states-and-implications-for-a-net-worth-tax/) 

Fortunately, the gap is slowly narrowing and median African American income is rising the most out of any other racial group in American. Unfortunately it still exists and discrimination is alive and well in employment practices as evidenced by similarly educated African Americans not performing as well as their white counterparts.

IMO Eastern European wealth inequality has a lot to do with governmental incompetence as you can see by the opinions of the people:

 [https://www.pewforum.org/2017/05/10/views-on-economic-issues/](https://www.pewforum.org/2017/05/10/views-on-economic-issues/) 

 Communism ruined Eastern Europe and completely destabilized all former Soviet Blocs which allowed for some pretty extreme political groups to come in and take complete advantage of these countries

 [https://www.globalresearch.ca/the-tragic-failure-of-post-communism-in-eastern-europe/23616](https://www.globalresearch.ca/the-tragic-failure-of-post-communism-in-eastern-europe/23616) 

So yes, I would say based on most data the divide is much greater between Western/Eastern Europe than African Americans/Whites in the USA. But the gap between the 1% vs the bottom 99% is much worse than that of either."
69,AutoModerator,removecomment,2019-07-10 11:24:31,t1_etf2lta,"Short answer: lack of competition due to patents in the drug industry. Drug patents in particular get special treatment where holders can extend their patents OR file new patents with every improvement and change.

The microchip was patented in the US in 1964 with a 17 year expiration. The tech companies that make today's processors and computer chip use the microchip foundation but don't infringe on each other's technology by differentiation. An Intel chip doesn't work the same as an AMD chip. The microchip was a one and done patent whereas somthing like Insulin has a complex and complicated past. 

The original patent already expired but with the combination of new patents on methods for synthesizing and delivering insulin AND regulations (which lead to 1. expensive clinical testing and 2. prevents new entrants into the market), Insulin doesn't have a competitive market. The established big player(s) can redesign all aspects of Insulin and file patents for every change. And with that, they unilaterally decide to discontinue their older versions to basically restrict buyer choice. It's all about availability of substitutes. Also looking at the 2 industries, which is going to be heavily regulated and arguably rightfully so?

This is another way to think about it. Take the 2 categories, Computer products and Drugs.

Different computer products can substitute for each other. You need a calculator? You could get a calculator, a laptop, a desktop, or a phone. In contrast, if you need a solution to manage Diabetes, there is only 1 solution and no substitutes."

You may see students in the first line and professionals in the second -- the first line is for people who (given their circumstances) are relatively more willing to sacrifice time to save money, and the second for people who are relatively more willing / able to pay money to save time.  

Allocating goods by waiting in line vs by money takes the same principle to its logical conclusion."

88,AutoModerator,removecomment,2019-07-10 02:12:18,t1_ete79v3,"The debt the US carries has interest on it. In order to keep the debt from growing, the interest must be paid. This is called servicing the debt. As servicing the debt becomes a larger portion of government spending, we will have either less money for things we actually need, or we will have to borrow more. As the interest on the debt grows, the US becomes less and less creditworthy. The less creditworthy we are, the less faith there is in the American dollar and the financial system in general. 


The limit is reached when the servicing of the debt is impossible. This time will come at some point, but nobody wants to be the guy to bring up the bad news, so it is politically expedient to ignore this until it blows up."

American race gap:

 [https://www.sociologicalscience.com/download/vol-5/march/SocSci\_v5\_182to205.pdf](https://www.sociologicalscience.com/download/vol-5/march/SocSci_v5_182to205.pdf) 

But its a very complex issue on both ends and depends on how you define ""wealth gap."" The breakdown of income class by race is here:

 [https://www.brookings.edu/blog/social-mobility-memos/2018/02/27/the-middle-class-is-becoming-race-plural-just-like-the-rest-of-america/](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/social-mobility-memos/2018/02/27/the-middle-class-is-becoming-race-plural-just-like-the-rest-of-america/) 

But if you take away race and plot just distribution of wealth you can see that the top 1% in America owns the same amount of wealth as the next 9% below them, while the rest of the 90% is dropping significantly in wealth owned.

 [https://equitablegrowth.org/the-distribution-of-wealth-in-the-united-states-and-implications-for-a-net-worth-tax/](https://equitablegrowth.org/the-distribution-of-wealth-in-the-united-states-and-implications-for-a-net-worth-tax/) 

Fortunately, the gap is slowly narrowing and median African American income is rising the most out of any other racial group in American. Unfortunately it still exists and discrimination is alive and well in employment practices as evidenced by similarly educated African Americans not performing as well as their white counterparts.

IMO Eastern European wealth inequality has a lot to do with governmental incompetence as you can see by the opinions of the people:

 [https://www.pewforum.org/2017/05/10/views-on-economic-issues/](https://www.pewforum.org/2017/05/10/views-on-economic-issues/) 

 Communism ruined Eastern Europe and completely destabilized all former Soviet Blocs which allowed for some pretty extreme political groups to come in and take complete advantage of these countries

Questions they ask in basic econ like ""if investment increases, what does GDP do?"" are basically like asking, ""if aggregate demand increases, what happens to aggregate demand?"". (GDP and aggregate demand are essentially the same thing.) It's incredibly elementary and has no deeper explanatory power.

More interesting to examine would be what *permitted or triggered* the rise in spending to begin with. Was it that people started digging into their savings a bit more? Was it that more resources were found which permitted increased production of goods and services? Was it that the government increased the money supply in the economy and created temporary stimulation which lasted long enough (before the euphoria died off and inflation set in) to render an increase in real spending in the latest GDP figure?

PPP adjustments decrease the difference substantially, but there's still a larger difference than the black vs white one.

It is not entirely clear what impact the difference between average and median will make; assuming average means mean, there tends to be a larger difference between means than between medians.

1. Are we talking about mean wealth or median wealth, when we talk about wealth gap? There is a huge difference, particularly in the USA, because of the greater social inequality than in Europe. Median wealth is a better indicator of what the average person owns than mean wealth is, obviously.

2. It really depends on what you mean by Eastern Europe. If you mean former socialist republics, you'd have to include the Czech republic, but Czechs usually do not consider themselves Eastern Europeans, and usually take offence at that. If you mean geographically, you'd probably have to include Greece in Eastern Europe, even though it was the only capitalist country in the region.

3. The wealth gap is less important in Europe than it is in the US, because of more reliable social safety nets. A pensioner can get by with zero net wealth in many European countries much better than in the USA. So while you can make the comparison, the comparison will not be very meaningful.

4. Also, PPP. What you can actually do with the same wealth is quite different if you live in London vs. in Kiev, and this difference is much greater than if you take black-majority neighbourhoods vs white-majority neighbourhoods in the US.

All of this being said, taking **mean** wealth, and not doing PPP:

* According to [this link](https://voxeu.org/article/decline-african-american-and-hispanic-wealth-great-recession), the ratio of the mean net worth of blacks to whites in the US is 0.14.

* According to [Credit Suisse](https://www.credit-suisse.com/corporate/en/research/research-institute/global-wealth-report/tables.html), we have, for some of the most populous countries in Europe:

    * France: 280k USD

    * United Kingdom: 279k USD

    * Italy: 218k USD

    * Germany: 215k USD

    * Spain: 191k USD

    * Greece: 108k USD

    * Slovenia: 79k USD

    * Czech Republic: 61k USD

    * Poland: 32k USD

    * Russia: 20k USD

    * Romania: 20k USD

    * Ukraine: 1.6k USD

So, taking an average for the Big Five of Western Europe of about 240k USD, we have.

**Smaller difference than blacks/whites in the US:**

* Greece / Big Five = 45%

* Slovenia / Big Five = 33%

* Czech Republic / Big Five = 25%

**Comparable to blacks/whites in the US:**

* Poland / Big Five = 13%

4. Also, PPP. What you can actually do with the same wealth is quite different if you live in London vs. in Kiev, and this difference is much greater than if you take black-majority neighbourhoods vs white-majority neighbourhoods in the US.

All of this being said, taking **mean** wealth, and not doing PPP:

* According to [this link](https://voxeu.org/article/decline-african-american-and-hispanic-wealth-great-recession), the ratio of the mean net worth of blacks to whites in the US is 0.14.

* According to [Credit Suisse](https://www.credit-suisse.com/corporate/en/research/research-institute/global-wealth-report/tables.html), we have, for some of the most populous countries in Europe:

    * France: 280k USD

    * United Kingdom: 279k USD

    * Italy: 218k USD

    * Germany: 215k USD

    * Spain: 191k USD

    * Greece: 108k USD

    * Slovenia: 79k USD

    * Czech Republic: 61k USD

    * Poland: 32k USD

    * Russia: 20k USD

    * Romania: 20k USD

    * Ukraine: 1.6k USD

So, taking an average for the Big Five of Western Europe of about 240k USD, we have.

**Smaller difference than blacks/whites in the US:**

* Greece / Big Five = 45%

* Slovenia / Big Five = 33%

* Czech Republic / Big Five = 25%

**Comparable to blacks/whites in the US:**

* Poland / Big Five = 13%

**Greater difference than blacks/whites in the US:**

* Romania / Big Five = 8%.

* Russia / Big Five = 8%.

* Ukraine / Big Five = 0.7%"

Wikipedia indicates yes, as a first order approximation.  Using the Wikipedia pages below, you'll see a >3x difference in average monthly net income from west to east Europe, while the claim for black vs white median income is .74 to 1.

PPP adjustments decrease the difference substantially, but there's still a larger difference than the black vs white one.

It is not entirely clear what impact the difference between average and median will make; assuming average means mean, there tends to be a larger difference between means than between medians.

More interesting to examine would be what *permitted or triggered* the rise in spending to begin with. Was it that people started digging into their savings a bit more? Was it that more resources were found which permitted increased production of goods and services? Was it that the government increased the money supply in the economy and created temporary stimulation which lasted long enough (before the euphoria died off and inflation set in) to render an increase in real spending in the latest GDP figure?

State-by-state net federal spending (ie spending received minus taxes paid) is presented in Table 3 and Figure 2.

This reflects the fact that urban areas in the US tend to be much wealthier and economically dynamic, producing lots of taxable income. Rural areas tend to be more poor, receiving more benefits. Rural parts of the US also tend to receive relatively more military spending (big bases), highway spending, and farm subsidies.  The political implications are interesting.

But people sometimes do this analysis at the state level, for example in [this report ](https://rockinst.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/1-7-19b-Balance-of-Payments.pdf) from the Rockefeller Institute. State-by-state net federal spending (ie spending received minus taxes paid) is presented in Table 3 and Figure 2. You can see that the highest net “givers” to the federal government are urbanized states like NJ, MA, and CT, while the biggest “takers” (leaving aside VA and MD where there are a lot of federal agencies, and places with a lot of retirees getting SS and Medicare such as FL and AZ) are rural or mixed states such as KY, NC and AL. 

This reflects the fact that urban areas in the US tend to be much wealthier and economically dynamic, producing lots of taxable income. Rural areas tend to be more poor, receiving more benefits. Rural parts of the US also tend to receive relatively more military spending (big bases), highway spending, and farm subsidies.  The political implications are interesting.

Edit: BTW the table is a little misleading since states are listed in the order of total net spending, so the top and bottom are skewed towards bigger states. The per capita figures, which get closer to answering OP’s question, are used for the colors in Figure 2."

For example, public administration is an inter-disciplinary field which originally came from political science, but had a very heavy influence from micro economics. Public administration deals with public policy, government studies, administration/state bureaucracies, etc. Having an understanding of the basic of economics is really helpful. 

To quote Maserumule and Mashigo ([2014](https://www.aabri.com/manuscripts/09210.pdf)):

> Economics permeates each and every sector of human activity and interaction. It is
about how limited resources are used to create wealth. In the contemporary world, public
administration plays a critical role of providing direction in terms of how that wealth should
be distributed, although its involvement in the economy differs from one country to another
depending on a particular economic system at play. The public administrators are therefore
faced with the challenges of taking decisions within the context of economic realities of their
communities. They often make decisions in the face of limited resources. This is a
fundamental economic challenge. A sound knowledge of the fundamentals of economics is,
therefore, essential for all public administrators and policy makers in the business of
government. 
> The fundamentals of economics include, among others, inflation, unemployment,
poverty, national and international trades, fiscal and monetary policies, and the economic
behavior of households and organizations in the private and public sectors. 
> Engineers, lawyers, medical doctors, nurses, social workers and physicists, just to
mention but few, also invariably need some degree of understanding of economics to
efficiently carry out their specialized functions. Including economics as an “anchor subject”
in all set of courses that are being pursued for various professional and academic
qualifications in the social and natural sciences is a sound approach to curriculum
development as it would ensure that institutions of higher learning produces the caliber of
graduates that are well-rounded and could easily understand the economic dynamics that
underpin human actions.  

Anecdotally, there's often a disconnect between political scientists and economists, but this line tends to blur above undergraduate level significantly. Siloing from the paradigm wars is less of a thing, at least in the UK. And the rise of mixed methods across the social science is commonly seen as a net good ([Denzin, 2010](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1077800410364608)). It's often seen as a panacea depending on the discipline.  But the applicability of economic methods and theory really depends on the social phenomena under investigation and related research questions. Sometimes social phenomena can be heterogeneous, complex, nuanced, and bounded to particular historical-social-cultural instances which may make econometric modelling problematic ([Krauss, 2017](http://www.lse.ac.uk/philosophy/blog/2017/01/09/the-scientific-limits-of-understanding-complex-social-phenomena/)).  

On a further participatory democratic model having informed citizens, who understands the basics of economics, is also a common positive.

Edit: there's a lot of helpful and approachable resources nowadays for laymen too. I find The Curriculum Open-Access Resources in Economics Project ([CORE Project](https://www.core-econ.org/))'s stuff really great for a basic undergraduate understanding of theory.

This is ample time to personally prepare and profit from the situation.

I of course am located in the country, which makes me wonder.

What are the good reads on the topic? Where can i learn about what happened with other countries citizens upon their entrance?

Could it be beneficial to take a loan in kuna beforehand so to get it converted to euro, or not?

What about my bank account? Should i start converting my savings into euro?

The reason for the high P/E ratio is because the Federal Funds rate was set so low for so long. The price of a stock is made up of it’s expected earnings and the interest rate at which it can service commercial paper. Most large company’s use commercial paper to finance short term spending or long term investments. That interest rate changes based on the federal funds rate. If the rate at which a company can borrow is low, then this would appreciate the stock and inflate the P/E ratio. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, it’s just the market valuing a company because of high potential growth. The negative effects would come from animal spirits, when there is a large dip in the market, but it’s just a correction and people panic sort of creating a self fulfilling prophecy."

255,lawrencekhoo,approvecomment,2019-07-08 05:19:09,t1_et5hbso,"Lots to unpack here:

* correlation != causation
* You're exactly right that growth is another way to earn returns from the market, and that's not accounted for in P/E.  It's typical now for things like large tech stocks (Amazon, Alphabet etc.) to never or almost never pay dividends.  When some of the hugest companies in the index don't pay dividends it tends to skew P/E a lot.  Looking at historical averages is less than indicative since this wasn't the case for much of the earlier part of history, so this approach is less than meaningful.
* Market prices for stocks are influenced by a number of external factors, including changes in supply/demand for non-stock investments (bonds, real estate etc.) and relative foreign investment in US stocks.  Stock markets and economic health only kind of track along with each other, and individual stocks even less so.
* Even if your hypothesis were correct (I don't think it is), if you discard the 2007 crisis as an extreme outlier, P/E is still in better shape than it was before the dotcom bust and the 9/11 slump, so there's two recent-ish occurrences that would tend to work against this assertion that P/E is cause for concern.

All of this said, I still don't have much smart to say about the current state of things.  We're in a truly weird time economically with a long expansion and historically low unemployment, near-zero interest rates *and* really low inflation all occurring together even as we're entering a self-inflicted trade war.  It's so strange that economists can't really even agree on what to make of it, and it might be years before we can look back and decide if we should have been worried."

Another thing to consider is the power of dollar cost averaging. Even if you start putting money in stocks during an overvalued market, you still do OK.

Liability:  A present obligation of an entity, resulting from past events, expected to result in an outflow of economic benefits

If a bank buys a bond, it will expect a payment in the future. i.e., its a resource, gained by a purchase, which will translate into an inflow of cash. --> Asset.

If a bank issues a bond, at a future point in time, it will be obliged to pay whoever owns the bond, i.e., it is currently an obligation for the bank, due to a sale, where at a certain point in time there'll be a cash outflow. --> Liability

E: So, to answer your question: depending on whether a bank would buy or issue a bond, it would be an asset or a liability. In your case, the bank will receive money in the future; so it is a resource from which it will gain economic benefit. Thus it is an asset, thus your proposition is false."

307,AutoModerator,removecomment,2019-07-07 04:35:11,t1_et5hbso,"Lots to unpack here:

* correlation != causation
* You're exactly right that growth is another way to earn returns from the market, and that's not accounted for in P/E.  It's typical now for things like large tech stocks (Amazon, Alphabet etc.) to never or almost never pay dividends.  When some of the hugest companies in the index don't pay dividends it tends to skew P/E a lot.  Looking at historical averages is less than indicative since this wasn't the case for much of the earlier part of history, so this approach is less than meaningful.
* Market prices for stocks are influenced by a number of external factors, including changes in supply/demand for non-stock investments (bonds, real estate etc.) and relative foreign investment in US stocks.  Stock markets and economic health only kind of track along with each other, and individual stocks even less so.
* Even if your hypothesis were correct (I don't think it is), if you discard the 2007 crisis as an extreme outlier, P/E is still in better shape than it was before the dotcom bust and the 9/11 slump, so there's two recent-ish occurrences that would tend to work against this assertion that P/E is cause for concern.

All of this said, I still don't have much smart to say about the current state of things.  We're in a truly weird time economically with a long expansion and historically low unemployment, near-zero interest rates *and* really low inflation all occurring together even as we're entering a self-inflicted trade war.  It's so strange that economists can't really even agree on what to make of it, and it might be years before we can look back and decide if we should have been worried."
308,AutoModerator,removecomment,2019-07-07 04:03:53,t1_et5fbwh,"I share your concern, but I would argue that you’re just showing a correlation and not causality. The reason for the high P/E ratio is because the Federal Funds rate was set so low for so long. The price of a stock is made up of it’s expected earnings and the interest rate at which it can service commercial paper. Most large company’s use commercial paper to finance short term spending or long term investments. That interest rate changes based on the federal funds rate. If the rate at which a company can borrow is low, then this would appreciate the stock and inflate the P/E ratio. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, it’s just the market valuing a company because of high potential growth. The negative effects would come from animal spirits, when there is a large dip in the market, but it’s just a correction and people panic sort of creating a self fulfilling prophecy."

&#x200B;

Information/knowledge is a public good, so once generated, it is very difficult to profit from (unless there are corrective policies like IP protection). This means that without intervention in the market, education/gaining information will be underinvested in. When a person gains education, they benefit but so does society because that person's labour will be more productive. Since information is a non-rivalrous good, it is more efficient to transmit information to as many people as possible at one time (ie. classrooms are more efficient than teaching each child individually). 

&#x200B;

Healthcare has similar features but is more complicated. First, healthy people are generally more productive than sick people and so society is more productive when the population is healthy. Depending on the issue, the negative externality of being sick is that you expose other to infection. In addition, the price elasticity for health is basically 0 -- meaning demand does not change as price increases. Reasons for this are complicated, but two important factors are: 

&#x200B;

\-  humans tend to value their lives more than money, so they will pay all the money they have for treatment if it will save their life

&#x200B;

\- most people don't pay the full costs of their own healthcare (insurance), so are less sensitive to underlying prices.

When the lack of price elasticity is combined with monopoly patent protections for new pharmaceuticals, prices can get very high, but this is not necessarily a market failure."

There are many differences, for example small 'collectives' (like Nature's Bakery in Madison, WI with 8 employees) usually make decisions with meetings of all members, but large co-ops (like the Mondragon Cooperative in Spain with 80,000+ employees) elect a board of employees who hire a general manager who hires other managers.

Likely so, since there aren't exploitative executives or extractive capital and they focus on serving their members rather than maximizing profit.

But I recently came across this [book review](https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/neoliberalism-world-order-review-quinn-slobodian-globalists) of the historian Adam Tooze, which provides an interesting narrative to some of the assumptions of Austrian economics.

>Torn apart by self-determination, the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Dual Monarchy in 1918 was not just the failure of a complex multinational polity. In the eyes of von Mises and his ideological allies, it threw into question the order of private property. It was the First World War and the Great Depression that birthed democratic nation-states, which no longer merely shielded private property but claimed control over a national economy conceived of as a resource to be supervised by the state. Private property that had once been secured by a remote but even-handed imperial sovereign was now at the mercy of national democracy.

>Faced with this shocking transformation, neoliberals set out not to demolish the state but to create an international order strong enough to contain the dangerous forces of democracy and encase the private economy in its own autonomous sphere.

>In the face of the Great Depression, they not only came to doubt the predictive power of business-cycle research, they came to see the very act of enumerating and counting “the economy” as itself a threat to the order of private property. It was when you conceived of the economy as an object, whether for purposes of scientific investigation or policy intervention, that you opened the door to redistributive, democratic economic policy. Following their own edicts, after crushing the labor movement, the next line of defense of private property was therefore to declare the economy unknowable.

>The entire point was to silence policy debate. By focusing on broad questions of the economic constitution, rather than the details of economic processes, neoliberals sought to outlaw prying questions about how things actually worked. It was when you started asking for statistics and assembling spreadsheets that you took the first dangerous step toward politicizing “the economy.”"

The traditional farming today consume more energy than what it produces (pesticides, tractors, irrigation, and so). It also increases biodiversity enriching the land with life while traditional farming literally kill all life in the land.

In other words, if the nominal wages didn't increase, the purchasing power would only be at (100/191,1) = ~52% of the base year. Basically the prices doubled, so you can only afford half of before. 

A salary cut off 91,1% would mean that that you are only earning 8,9% of what you've earned before. In this case your income would decrease by a factor of 11. 

To get an equivalent reduction of purchasing power through Inflation (if nominal wages stay constant) you can easily calculate as follows: 100/x=0,089  -->  x=100/0,089= 1123,6%

where x stands for the inflation compared to the base year.
Hope i could help.

Edit: to follow up on purchasing power: while the purchasing power of a currency often decreases over time (through higher prices), often nominal wages rise as well. So bluntly spoken, you get less for your Dollar, but you're earning more Dollars. If nominal income rises at the same rate as prices you are able to purchase as much as before. If nominal income rises faster than the prices your real income (income adjusted for price niveau) rises and vice versa."

They only represent production workers, and it is misleading to not include the increasing amount of skilled workers thanks to the increasing access to education. Second, Krugman numbers doesn't taking into account other form of compensation such as employer-sponsored healthcare, safer work environment, unemployment insurance, food stamps, tax credits/deduction, and so on. When you adjust for these factors, what you will see is that real wages has gone up but it is still lower than gross production per worker per hour. Be careful with gross production because technology is playing a huge role in our production economy today. These technology depreciate, and when we adjust depreciation we get ""real"" gross production. All and done, worker's compensation has actually risen to match their productivity.

> A recently emerging consensus claims not only that economic inequality has detrimental effects on economic growth in general, but also that differences in economic inequality across the American continent during the 19th century are responsible for the radically different economic performances of the north and south of the continent. In this paper we investigate this hypothesis using unique 19th century micro data on land ownership and political office holding in the state of Cundinamarca, Colombia. Our results shed considerable doubt on this consensus. Even though Cundinamarca is indeed more unequal than the Northern United States at the time, within Cundinamarca municipalities that were more unequal in the 19th century (as measured by the land gini) are more developed today. Instead, we argue that political rather than economic inequality might be more important in understanding long-run development paths and document that municipalities with greater political inequality, as measured by political concentration, are less developed today. We also show that during this critical period the politically powerful were able to amass greater wealth, which is consistent with one of the channels through which political inequality might affect economic allocations. Overall our findings shed doubt on the conventional wisdom and suggest that research on long-run comparative development should investigate the implications of political inequality as well as those of economic inequality.

The real answer is: I don’t know. But look at academic articles and papers. Look at nber and other peer reviewed sources and decide for yourself.

But, without you describing the exact methods the authors used to come to the conclusion “the inequality is soaring” I can’t really tell you. Plus soaring is subjective. Hell, even the use of the Gini coefficient is sometimes controversial but it’s generally widely used by economists. 

But the general consensus as far as I can tell is that generally inclusive economic and political institutions promote well functioning economics. A fair or equal wealth/income distribution may or may not be the product of that economic and political landscape. But the goal is to promote prosperity for all and those generally do better at that goal than non inclusive economic policy or political policy. 

And finally one last note, global inequality is decreasing while developed inter country inequality is increasing.

> A recently emerging consensus claims not only that economic inequality has detrimental effects on economic growth in general, but also that differences in economic inequality across the American continent during the 19th century are responsible for the radically different economic performances of the north and south of the continent. In this paper we investigate this hypothesis using unique 19th century micro data on land ownership and political office holding in the state of Cundinamarca, Colombia. Our results shed considerable doubt on this consensus. Even though Cundinamarca is indeed more unequal than the Northern United States at the time, within Cundinamarca municipalities that were more unequal in the 19th century (as measured by the land gini) are more developed today. Instead, we argue that political rather than economic inequality might be more important in understanding long-run development paths and document that municipalities with greater political inequality, as measured by political concentration, are less developed today. We also show that during this critical period the politically powerful were able to amass greater wealth, which is consistent with one of the channels through which political inequality might affect economic allocations. Overall our findings shed doubt on the conventional wisdom and suggest that research on long-run comparative development should investigate the implications of political inequality as well as those of economic inequality.

The real answer is: I don’t know. But look at academic articles and papers. Look at nber and other peer reviewed sources and decide for yourself.

But, without you describing the exact methods the authors used to come to the conclusion “the inequality is soaring” I can’t really tell you. Plus soaring is subjective. Hell, even the use of the Gini coefficient is sometimes controversial but it’s generally widely used by economists. 

But the general consensus as far as I can tell is that generally inclusive economic and political institutions promote well functioning economics. A fair or equal wealth/income distribution may or may not be the product of that economic and political landscape. But the goal is to promote prosperity for all and those generally do better at that goal than non inclusive economic policy or political policy. 

And finally one last note, global inequality is decreasing while developed inter country inequality is increasing.

What I learned watching documentaries as well is that these alternatives farmings not only can produce more food for square meter, but also consume less water, less to no pesticides and have much less energy input. The traditional farming today consume more energy than what it produces (pesticides, tractors, irrigation, and so). It also increases biodiversity enriching the land with life while traditional farming literally kill all life in the land.

But I recently came across this [book review](https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/neoliberalism-world-order-review-quinn-slobodian-globalists) of the historian Adam Tooze, which provides an interesting narrative to some of the assumptions of Austrian economics.

>Torn apart by self-determination, the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Dual Monarchy in 1918 was not just the failure of a complex multinational polity. In the eyes of von Mises and his ideological allies, it threw into question the order of private property. It was the First World War and the Great Depression that birthed democratic nation-states, which no longer merely shielded private property but claimed control over a national economy conceived of as a resource to be supervised by the state. Private property that had once been secured by a remote but even-handed imperial sovereign was now at the mercy of national democracy.

>Faced with this shocking transformation, neoliberals set out not to demolish the state but to create an international order strong enough to contain the dangerous forces of democracy and encase the private economy in its own autonomous sphere.

>In the face of the Great Depression, they not only came to doubt the predictive power of business-cycle research, they came to see the very act of enumerating and counting “the economy” as itself a threat to the order of private property. It was when you conceived of the economy as an object, whether for purposes of scientific investigation or policy intervention, that you opened the door to redistributive, democratic economic policy. Following their own edicts, after crushing the labor movement, the next line of defense of private property was therefore to declare the economy unknowable.

>The entire point was to silence policy debate. By focusing on broad questions of the economic constitution, rather than the details of economic processes, neoliberals sought to outlaw prying questions about how things actually worked. It was when you started asking for statistics and assembling spreadsheets that you took the first dangerous step toward politicizing “the economy.”"

410,AutoModerator,removecomment,2019-07-05 19:47:35,t1_esz6dzp,"Healthcare and education are both markets with externalities, so it depends on what you mean by ""failure"". 

&#x200B;

Information/knowledge is a public good, so once generated, it is very difficult to profit from (unless there are corrective policies like IP protection). This means that without intervention in the market, education/gaining information will be underinvested in. When a person gains education, they benefit but so does society because that person's labour will be more productive. Since information is a non-rivalrous good, it is more efficient to transmit information to as many people as possible at one time (ie. classrooms are more efficient than teaching each child individually). 

&#x200B;

Healthcare has similar features but is more complicated. First, healthy people are generally more productive than sick people and so society is more productive when the population is healthy. Depending on the issue, the negative externality of being sick is that you expose other to infection. In addition, the price elasticity for health is basically 0 -- meaning demand does not change as price increases. Reasons for this are complicated, but two important factors are: 

&#x200B;

\-  humans tend to value their lives more than money, so they will pay all the money they have for treatment if it will save their life

&#x200B;

\- most people don't pay the full costs of their own healthcare (insurance), so are less sensitive to underlying prices.

&#x200B;

When the lack of price elasticity is combined with monopoly patent protections for new pharmaceuticals, prices can get very high, but this is not necessarily a market failure."

In this vein there is an entire field of empirical work just in the area of demand estimation, which is big in my field Industrial Organization. 

Another point to make, is something my first year PhD econometric professor. You can't get truth from statistics. Statistics give correlations and we usual require some theory to try and argue for causation. Of course there are statistical methods like IV and quasi-natural experiments as well.

&#x200B;

There are many differences, for example small 'collectives' (like Nature's Bakery in Madison, WI with 8 employees) usually make decisions with meetings of all members, but large co-ops (like the Mondragon Cooperative in Spain with 80,000+ employees) elect a board of employees who hire a general manager who hires other managers.  In smaller worker co-ops or collectives, employees usually divide up responsibilities.

&#x200B;

\>  Could worker cooperatives be a good way to prevent inequality if there was a more effective way finance their start up? 

&#x200B;

Likely so, since there aren't exploitative executives or extractive capital and they focus on serving their members rather than maximizing profit. Capital is definitely an issue for co-ops, but the biggest hurdle is more people learning about co-ops, and collective entrepreneurship has its own challenges."

In other words, if the nominal wages didn't increase, the purchasing power would only be at (100/191,1) = ~52% of the base year. Basically the prices doubled, so you can only afford half of before. 

A salary cut off 91,1% would mean that that you are only earning 8,9% of what you've earned before. In this case your income would decrease by a factor of 11. 

To get an equivalent reduction of purchasing power through Inflation (if nominal wages stay constant) you can easily calculate as follows: 100/x=0,089  -->  x=100/0,089= 1123,6%

where x stands for the inflation compared to the base year.
Hope i could help.

Edit: to follow up on purchasing power: while the purchasing power of a currency often decreases over time (through higher prices), often nominal wages rise as well. So bluntly spoken, you get less for your Dollar, but you're earning more Dollars. If nominal income rises at the same rate as prices you are able to purchase as much as before. If nominal income rises faster than the prices your real income (income adjusted for price niveau) rises and vice versa."

They only represent production workers, and it is misleading to not include the increasing amount of skilled workers thanks to the increasing access to education. Second, Krugman numbers doesn't taking into account other form of compensation such as employer-sponsored healthcare, safer work environment, unemployment insurance, food stamps, tax credits/deduction, and so on. When you adjust for these factors, what you will see is that real wages has gone up but it is still lower than gross production per worker per hour. Be careful with gross production because technology is playing a huge role in our production economy today. These technology depreciate, and when we adjust depreciation we get ""real"" gross production. All and done, worker's compensation has actually risen to match their productivity.

If they forgave all of the debt, that big balloon of debt that the US govt has now would get bigger because they'd have to say, ""you remember those 1,6T USD, well, we won't get that anymore"", so they would have to come up with that money from somewhere else (issue more bonds, etc), or cut back on 1.6T USD of govt spending, etc.

541,BainCapitalist,approvecomment,2019-07-03 17:25:17,t1_esotrtw,"FYI, 14 countries in central and western Africa have been using a single currency since 1945, the [CFA franc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFA_franc). Of the 14 countries planning to join the Eco, 8 are already using the CFA franc, and would switch to the Eco. So the change would not be a big deal really. If it all goes as planned, we would go from 14 countries using CFA franc + 8 loose countries to 14 countries using Eco + 6 countries using the CFA franc. Not a huge change in and of itself, except for the fact that Nigeria would be joining the party, and Nigeria's economy is pretty big by African standards: [Nigeria's GDP is bigger than both Egypt's and South Africa's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_African_countries_by_GDP_(nominal\)).

The big question is, rather, would the Eco / CFA still be pegged to the Euro, be allowed to fluctuate under its own central bank (unlikely), be pegged to the USD (also unlikely), or be pegged to the Chinese Yuan (quite possible)? The answer to your question about the economic effects of the Eco for the member countries depends in large part on this big decision."
542,BainCapitalist,approvecomment,2019-07-03 17:24:19,t1_eso762m,"What a fun question!  Let's start with some quick groundwork before diving in.

Markets are just places where buyers and sellers exchange use-rights to things.  For example, when I bought my coffee this morning, I traded the use-right to the dollars in my hand for the use-right to (some of) the coffee in their pot.  We both agreed to the terms of the exchange, and we both walked away from the exchange happier.  What this means is that voluntary trade is mutually beneficial (or at least, going into it, we expect the trade to be mutually beneficial (Occasionally, we find out that we were wrong, which we just call ""ex post regret."").

Sometimes, though, two people's voluntary trade confers/imposes benefits/costs on other people.  This is most readily apparent with respect to pollution, where a factory that produces products but has pollution as a byproduct imposes costs on the surrounding neighborhood.  Or you can think of noise pollution as a thing, where just the sheer act of making noise is, itself, a cost that is imposed on someone.  Let's stick with noise pollution as our example.

My neighbors like to bounce a basketball on the ground and throw it vaguely toward a basketball hoop.  I know, I could have just said that they ""play basketball"" but that would be disingenuous to the sport - what they are doing cannot possibly be considered ""basketball.""  They especially like to do this late at night in the summer time and their driveway is right next to our bedroom window, which we like to have open because it's hot out!  Now, I'm an economics professor and I'm not teaching any summer courses this year, so I don't really mind the lack of sleep because I can just sleep in later.  My wife on the other hand is a surgeon and she operates at 7:00 AM sharp (and on kids!).  She needs the sleep so she can do the best work possible.

In an unregulated world, I suspect that my neighbors would be outside until 3:00 AM every night doing their thing.  But my city has a noise ordinance, which states very clearly that the hours between 11:00 PM and 7:00 AM are designated as ""quiet hours.""  We can think of this ordinance as a form of a regulation, which puts limits on my neighbors' behavior.  Sure, I could just walk over there and ask them nicely to be quiet, but depending on the situation, that can be socially awkward.  This ordinance prevents this.

In a more serious example, we (in the US) have regulations in place that ensure that the workplace is safe (OSHA).  This basically says that your place of employment will be pretty damn safe and that your employer cannot ask you to do anything that would be considered ""unsafe."" 

We in the US also regulate organ donation in an attempt to prevent people from stealing/harvesting organs from other people but also to prevent people from making decisions that might help in the short run (getting money for e.g. a kidney) but have long term health consequences that they might not be fully aware of (the increased chance of renal failure).

The benefits of regulation are pretty clear: they keep people safe and they help prevent ""bad"" behavior.

The costs of regulation are less clear.  For one, enforcing those regulations is itself costly.  Second, in many cases, the regulations prevent what would otherwise be voluntary trade, which as we said earlier, is mutually beneficial.  For example, the FDA up until recently did not allow terminally ill patients to use experimental drugs unless they were part of the study.  While this may keep people safe in general, with terminally ill patients, it sometimes condemned them to death without even being able to ""throw up a Hail Mary,"" so to speak.  And sometimes, everyone (including the FDA!) knew that the drug was safe and worked, but it hadn't gotten all the signatures yet and so the patient still couldn't receive the treatment.  This is really sad and is a cost of ""regulation.""

As economists, we would weigh the likely (marginal) benefits against the likely (marginal) costs and determine what to do from there.  This might be gauche in some situations, but it might also not be in others.

For what it's worth, and since you asked for our insights, I personally think we're too quick to jump to ""there's a problem, we must regulate it away!"" I think that there are other, private solutions to the problems that regulation purports to solve that might be much, much more efficient.  Ronald Coase has some [great insights here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coase_theorem), with the idea that people can simply bargain over ""property rights.""  Burt Folsom also wrote a great book called *The Myth of the Robber Barons*, where he details e.g. Rockefeller's success as a function of him cleaning up rivers by using the sludge that refining oil produced to make wax candles, paraffin wax, etc.

Am I saying that the optimal number of regulations is zero?  Of course not; that would be silly.  But someone once referred to regulation as the result of a moral failure of society.  I think that's appropriate."

The problem with the Euro was that it overstretched its reach. The economies of Northern Europe (France, Germany, Belgium etc) were quite different from (Italy, Greece, Spain, Portugal) especially during 2011 the peak of the crisis where they should have pursued opposite monetary policy but couldn't under the single currency. Greece especially really needed devalue their currency but Germany wasn't having it cause that would have been bad for their economy.

544,BainCapitalist,approvecomment,2019-07-03 17:23:29,t1_esnp5xl,"Switzerland did QE.

The difference was that the central bank could not simply just buy Swiss government bonds to implement QE. The reason being that there just aren't enough Swiss government bonds around. They had to buy a lot of foreign government bonds and fx reserves as well.

But this is a general issue not necessarily limited to QE. The central bank's balance sheet was full of foreign assets even before QE, and even in the Swiss franc secured interbank market foreign assets are accepted as collateral. This is in contrast to the USA and EU, that limit eligible assets (as collateral or for QE purchases) to domestic assets (I don't know about Japan).

It is not so much the size of the economy that matters, but the size of the banking industry. Switzerland has a huge banking industry and hence needed a large QE intervention compared to its economy. Hence, exclusively buying assets from its own economy was not an option. It would have severely disrupted financial markets. You can't just buy 30-70% of an asset and expect markets to carry on as if it didn't happen, but with lower rates. The ECB thinks otherwise, and that's why they now lost grip on their money market interest rates ([check figure 1 and keep in mind that the dashed line constitutes the lower bound of their interest rate corridor](https://www.imf.org/~/media/Files/Publications/WP/2018/wp18258.ashx))."

That's not how it works. The vast majority of this money *is* in the hands of other people, companies, etc. Because they don't have their wealth in money, they have it in *assets*. Most likely the majority in financial products like stocks (Bezos definitely does, no idea about Gates in detail).

Most of Bezos' wealth is in Amazon stocks, so not money, but something he can exchange for money. If he were to get rid of those, someone else would have to give up their money. Amazon could buy them (although since that would be a bit fishy, with him being the owner and all that, but ignoring that for a minute) which would mean Amazon would have *less* money to grow, employ people, etc.

Gates assets are more diversified, he only owns about 1% of Microsoft, and with the rest of the money, he did exactly what you suggest. He gave money to companies (in return for shares of those companies). That's literally the entire point of shares, companies sell a part of their company, a share, and take that money to finance their business. Although details are undisclosed, Gates most likely funds quite a lot of companies that way.

Just as a sidenote, this is called equity financing (instead of debt financing, taking out loans). You're selling what you have, so in this case, your company, or a portion of it. This isn't quite that literal, imagine it as the right to own a slice of a pie, but everyone who also owns the right to a slice of the pie has to agree on whether to eat it or sell it or throw it out or whatever.

Companies can raise money and control their shares. They can buyback shares, which for simplicities sake let's say just get destroyed, but since you then have less shares, and everybody who owns a share owns a larger part of the company, they get more valuable. You own a bigger part of the pie now. Or they can issue new shares, so go and sell smaller slices of the pie, which means of course that each slice will be a bit less valuable, but also that people who want a ""new"" slice will have to pay the company directly.

Oh, and not to mention, of course most of the time stock is not traded between people and the company, but between stockholders and other people.

Let's go back to Bezos. Another thing you suggest is that his wealth takes away from company money, taxes, wages, etc. That's not quite how it works.

Let's say you own a company, a lemonade stand. Let's say everything you need to operate that stand was gifted to you. You work for a while, make a profit, and eventually make enough to open a second stand. You still own both stands. Any costs are paid from the income your company makes selling lemonade.

This continues, your company grows, and because it grows and has more and more income, it becomes more valuable. You're still the owner of everything. Your lemonade business is eventually worth billions of dollars.

And since you own it, *you* are worth billions of dollars. That never required you to take any money out of the business, or really have your personal finances interact or influence company finances at all. You're simply rich because you own a valuable company (well, and apparently did a good job building a lemonade empire). Your wealth grew because the value of the company grew. And the value of the company grew because it sold a lot of lemonade."
552,BainCapitalist,removecomment,2019-07-03 17:20:07,t1_eskps94,"I’m not an economist so don’t know if I’m allowed to answer (I am a lawyer with a poly sci undergrad so have had a lot of intro economics and politics theory type economics). 

The way I think about it is it is about the right amount of regulation - like a game that needs rules to make the game work, but too many rules big it down. Ever seen that old commercial with 100 people trying to play tennis on the same court? It doesn’t work. That’s a deregulated market. It doesn’t work. 

Pros of deregulation CAN be lower barriers to entry which improves competition. But the flip side is that the deregulation can lead to monopolies, collusion among existing companies on the market that leads to artificial pricing and higher barriers to entry. Complete deregulation allows companies to offload negative externalities in society (dumping waste into public land, water, air, etc., hurting the population and depleting natural resources without having to pay for those side effects).  Deregulation can drive up economic disparities - if we were all on a desert island don’t you think the guy with 5X more stuff then everyone else would quickly be able to use his wealth coupled with everyone else’s need to survive to hoard wealth and gain 10X as much as everyone else?

Pros of a regulated market include consumer health and safety, worker protections, and requiring companies to pay for the negative effects they cause on all of us. 

The downside of regulation comes if it is heavy handed and not done correctly - barriers to entry become too high for new players, so there is no competition, which lets suppliers drive prices up. It can become too expensive for businesses to comply, which either drives up prices or constricts business that would otherwise grow."
553,BainCapitalist,approvecomment,2019-07-03 17:19:53,t1_eske85w,"Both regulation and deregulation/lack of regulation can make a market more or less efficient, or steer the market towards more desirable outcomes. No economist would make blanket statements about regulation in general being good or bad.

Markets don't always do everything they ""should"" on their own. One pretty important example right now are externalities. To be precise, the externalities of emissions. Externalities are costs incurred by parties who didn't chose to incur them. You didn't chose to incur the negative effects from the emissions of a factory on the other side of the world, yet you are affected by them. One possible solution to migitate that is to *make* the factory incur the cost, by for example putting a price on emissions that the factory has to pay. That's a ""good"" regulation, because it internalises the externality and makes the cost of a product reflect the actual cost of producing it more accurately.

Of course, there are ""bad"" regulations as well. Take for example rent control. The goal of rent control is usually to stabilise prices of rent controlled apartments. And indeed that's what rent control does. But it also leads to a laundry list of adverse effects. It discourages new housing from being build, it discourages landlords from maintaining their property, it leads to higher rent for adjacent property not under rent control, and other issues. Basically, it makes the underlying problem of a lack of supply worse, leads to other issues and only benefits a small group of people, and even those see some detrimental effects.

Then of course you have regulations that aren't necessarily efficient but are used for other reasons. Some countries for example have free colleges for everybody. That's not necessarily efficient because there *are* people who could afford to pay the ""full"" price but don't. You're giving them a free ride for no good reason (from an economics perspective). These countries still chose to have free college simply because they are fine with incurring that extra cost and basically just like it that way more, for one reason or another.

Besides all that, economics is mainly focused on looking bat what happens and what would happen if you do something (like implementing a regulation). It's not concerned with if what happens is good or bad, it just aims to understand and describe."

Of the 14 countries planning to join the Eco, 8 are already using the CFA franc, and would switch to the Eco. So the change would not be a big deal really. If it all goes as planned, we would go from 14 countries using CFA franc + 8 loose countries to 14 countries using Eco + 6 countries using the CFA franc. Not a huge change in and of itself, except for the fact that Nigeria would be joining the party, and Nigeria's economy is pretty big by African standards: [Nigeria's GDP is bigger than both Egypt's and South Africa's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_African_countries_by_GDP_(nominal\)).

The big question is, rather, would the Eco / CFA still be pegged to the Euro, be allowed to fluctuate under its own central bank (unlikely), be pegged to the USD (also unlikely), or be pegged to the Chinese Yuan (quite possible)?

Baked goods are cheap, and they don't last well either so you have to produce often, no one wants to shop at grocery stores that run out of bread, and regulatory requirements mean that unsold inventory is no longer profitable even if it's still edible.

A longer answer concerns things like [Economic Order Quantity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economicorderquantity.asp).  And although that math makes it looks neat and pretty, reliably estimating some of those variables like demanded quantity gets tough to do in practice.

The bigger societal problem with food waste is the stuff that winds up in dumpsters and garbage disposals instead of getting eaten; donating unsold goods isn't exactly ""waste"" per se.  They might actually be saving money by donating it instead of having to dispose of it, even without tax incentives or such."

570,AutoModerator,removecomment,2019-07-03 13:42:12,t1_eso762m,"What a fun question!  Let's start with some quick groundwork before diving in.

Markets are just places where buyers and sellers exchange use-rights to things.  For example, when I bought my coffee this morning, I traded the use-right to the dollars in my hand for the use-right to (some of) the coffee in their pot.  We both agreed to the terms of the exchange, and we both walked away from the exchange happier.  What this means is that voluntary trade is mutually beneficial (or at least, going into it, we expect the trade to be mutually beneficial (Occasionally, we find out that we were wrong, which we just call ""ex post regret."").

Sometimes, though, two people's voluntary trade confers/imposes benefits/costs on other people.  This is most readily apparent with respect to pollution, where a factory that produces products but has pollution as a byproduct imposes costs on the surrounding neighborhood.  Or you can think of noise pollution as a thing, where just the sheer act of making noise is, itself, a cost that is imposed on someone.  Let's stick with noise pollution as our example.

My neighbors like to bounce a basketball on the ground and throw it vaguely toward a basketball hoop.  I know, I could have just said that they ""play basketball"" but that would be disingenuous to the sport - what they are doing cannot possibly be considered ""basketball.""  They especially like to do this late at night in the summer time and their driveway is right next to our bedroom window, which we like to have open because it's hot out!  Now, I'm an economics professor and I'm not teaching any summer courses this year, so I don't really mind the lack of sleep because I can just sleep in later.  My wife on the other hand is a surgeon and she operates at 7:00 AM sharp (and on kids!).  She needs the sleep so she can do the best work possible.

In an unregulated world, I suspect that my neighbors would be outside until 3:00 AM every night doing their thing.  But my city has a noise ordinance, which states very clearly that the hours between 11:00 PM and 7:00 AM are designated as ""quiet hours.""  We can think of this ordinance as a form of a regulation, which puts limits on my neighbors' behavior.  Sure, I could just walk over there and ask them nicely to be quiet, but depending on the situation, that can be socially awkward.  This ordinance prevents this.

In a more serious example, we (in the US) have regulations in place that ensure that the workplace is safe (OSHA).  This basically says that your place of employment will be pretty damn safe and that your employer cannot ask you to do anything that would be considered ""unsafe."" 

We in the US also regulate organ donation in an attempt to prevent people from stealing/harvesting organs from other people but also to prevent people from making decisions that might help in the short run (getting money for e.g. a kidney) but have long term health consequences that they might not be fully aware of (the increased chance of renal failure).

The benefits of regulation are pretty clear: they keep people safe and they help prevent ""bad"" behavior.

The costs of regulation are less clear.  For one, enforcing those regulations is itself costly.  Second, in many cases, the regulations prevent what would otherwise be voluntary trade, which as we said earlier, is mutually beneficial.  For example, the FDA up until recently did not allow terminally ill patients to use experimental drugs unless they were part of the study.  While this may keep people safe in general, with terminally ill patients, it sometimes condemned them to death without even being able to ""throw up a Hail Mary,"" so to speak.  And sometimes, everyone (including the FDA!) knew that the drug was safe and worked, but it hadn't gotten all the signatures yet and so the patient still couldn't receive the treatment.  This is really sad and is a cost of ""regulation.""

As economists, we would weigh the likely (marginal) benefits against the likely (marginal) costs and determine what to do from there.  This might be gauche in some situations, but it might also not be in others.

For what it's worth, and since you asked for our insights, I personally think we're too quick to jump to ""there's a problem, we must regulate it away!"" I think that there are other, private solutions to the problems that regulation purports to solve that might be much, much more efficient.  Ronald Coase has some [great insights here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coase_theorem), with the idea that people can simply bargain over ""property rights.""  Burt Folsom also wrote a great book called *The Myth of the Robber Barons*, where he details e.g. Rockefeller's success as a function of him cleaning up rivers by using the sludge that refining oil produced to make wax candles, paraffin wax, etc.

Am I saying that the optimal number of regulations is zero?  Of course not; that would be silly.  But someone once referred to regulation as the result of a moral failure of society.  I think that's appropriate."

The difference was that the central bank could not simply just buy Swiss government bonds to implement QE. The reason being that there just aren't enough Swiss government bonds around. They had to buy a lot of foreign government bonds and fx reserves as well.

But this is a general issue not necessarily limited to QE. The central bank's balance sheet was full of foreign assets even before QE, and even in the Swiss franc secured interbank market foreign assets are accepted as collateral. This is in contrast to the USA and EU, that limit eligible assets (as collateral or for QE purchases) to domestic assets (I don't know about Japan).

It is not so much the size of the economy that matters, but the size of the banking industry. Switzerland has a huge banking industry and hence needed a large QE intervention compared to its economy. Hence, exclusively buying assets from its own economy was not an option. It would have severely disrupted financial markets. You can't just buy 30-70% of an asset and expect markets to carry on as if it didn't happen, but with lower rates.

Lots of this research looks at countries that are developing and similar gdp per capital and they then look at things such as the Gino coefficient and gdp growth rate. All things being equal, if you have a cross section of countries with similar gdp per capital at a bad e period, and the ones with higher growth have lower Gino coefficients, then you can make the assertion that there is a correlation between the variables. Like many things in economics you then have to make a theoretical argument for why. For example given the MPC a more equal wealth distribution encourages more equal consumption of goods and therefore kore domestic demand. Or a more equal wealth distribution means that education and healthcare is more widely available and therefore productivity and capital accumulation occurs faster."

Because of outsourcing and the economy that supports it, there is no chance for ""true cost"" economics.  And you can only live above your means for so long before you go bankrupt, and as a nation and add a global economy, that's where we are headed.

EDIT:

For anyone that doesn't know, BainCapitalist is a well versed and knowledgeable economics commentator here.

Which is why this is so absurd.

First off, his link was about corporate taxes, and I think its fair to say that corporate taxes can be viewed as a double tax. There is significant animosity towards corporate taxes in the economics world, and you can find articles and statements from people like Paul Krugman (Nobel prize winning 500lb gorilla of the economics world) condemning corporate taxes.

The question however, was about taxes on capital gains.

Doesn't take much to see that capital gains are completely different from corporate taxes. Capital gains are also taxes on new income, and that new investment income isn't taxed twice, and I don't think there's even a shred of a convincing sounding argument for claiming otherwise.

So either BainCapitalist mistakenly thought my post was referencing corporate taxes, in which case, fair enough, or I have to question his integrity both for claiming that capital gains are an example of double taxation and for linking a thread about corporate taxes as a means of backing that claim up.

EDIT 2:

Just read through his post, and his argument seems to be that if you place a tax on something that returns compound interest, then the tax is too high because the tax effectively reduces the interest rate which grows money exponentially, so by reducing the exponent at which your money grows exponentially any tax on any return which is compounded is too high.

Those of you that are following this will hopefully see that this is nonsense. Taxes aren't doubled taxes just because they effectively reduce the return on investment, and the return of investment gets compounded such that the amount of money you lose through the tax grows exponentially year over year.

Its also not why corporate taxes are claimed to be a double tax. They're claimed to be double taxes because they're applied in addition to later income or capital gains taxes paid by the owners of the company.

Proponents of UBI say its a much better way of ensuring people get some minimum level of benefit than welfare. The reason is because of [welfare traps.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare_trap) Essentially, because welfare takes so long to get approved for, and because it is revoked when you get any employment, there is an incentive to refuse some forms of employment that are offered to you while on welfare. You wouldn't take a part-time job unless it paid you more than your welfare, and if you thought the job was seasonal you would just stay on welfare. UBI gets rid of this perverse incentive by paying you a fixed stipend regardless of your employment status. Even some free-market economists have proposed a form of UBI. Look at Milton Friedman's [negative income tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_income_tax).

A tax cut by definition only affects those that are paying taxes. This is not necessarily a bad thing, as people and corporations who pay taxes are productive members of society. When taxes are cut people have more disposable income. People either save this disposable income or spend it. When they spend it, it goes directly back into the economy as consumption. And because one person's spending is another person's income a chain reaction occurs that raises everyone's income. This is called the [multiplier effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplier_(economics)). When they save it get injected back into the economy in the form of investment. Generally this goes out in the form of new loans, which lowers interest rates and/or makes funding available to projects that wouldn't have otherwise had it. Or it can go into capital investment like purchasing stock. High stock prices provide a return on investment for shareholders which they can either spend or save. In addition, the shareholder returns attract new competitors and provide a funding source for company acquisitions. Acquisitions are good for innovation because they provide a funding source (exit) for startups.

The argument of which one is better is not an easy one to answer. Similar arguments to this one pop up in policy debate all the time. We call this debate [supply side](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply-side_economics) and [demand side](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand-side_economics) economics. Instead of giving you my view, let me show you how you would evaluate what questions you need to ask to determine which policy has more merit. The first thing we need to do is list all the potential consequences of both actions (good or bad) and then later on assign a weight to it.

**UBI:**

* Removes welfare trap (+)
* Helps low income families, reducing [externalities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality) like crime (+)
* Would likely raise inflation (-)
* Reduces administrative burden of social programs (+)

**Tax cuts**

* Reduces [deadweight loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excess_burden_of_taxation) (+)
* Results in more investment (+)
* Result in more consumption (+)
* Would likely raise inflation (-)
* Lowers government revenues (-)

UBI: Alright, so now we need to figure out the tangible benefit of removing the welfare trap, lowering externalities and the reduced admin burden and see if that outweighs the cost of inflation. Since more people are adding value in the economy, people are removed from low-value admin, and less crime is being committed, any potential inflation should be countered from the increased output through this policy. Its important that we did this, because a lot of Government spending is inflationary. Its inflationary when the benefit to society is less than the cost of implementing the policy and has a real negative multiplier. See [broken window fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_broken_window).

Tax cuts: alright, so does the improvement in projects funded, increased investment and increased consumption make up for the potentially higher inflation and lost government revenues? Well since more output is being produced by new projects, more projects are being funded with lending and IPOs, and stock prices are going up this should counteract the inflationary forces. Now we have to determine was the money better off in the hands of the government or the hands of the people. Generally the money is better spent in the hands of the people, because it is easier for people to find value-added projects in millions of small microcosms than for the central government to manage changes in these small communities. However, infrastructure investments are also essential to the strength of the economy. To solve this last question we need to study the effectiveness of 1 dollar of government spending vs. 1 dollar of private sector spending and determine which spending has the higher economic output. Once we solve this question then we will have a factual basis to form our opinions.

It should be noted, you could probably have some combination of both tax cuts and UBI to maximize efficiency. It doesn't have to be one or the other. This process is also iterative. I may have forgotten an effect, made an assumption, or maybe the variables change or are not linear ie: [laffer curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laffer_curve). This is not a static model, which is why we need to test our hypothesis through regression in multiple markets over multiple time periods to become confident in the answers.

They don't, that's the point.  They are ""ascribed"" less worth, that's the point of outsourcing.  Businesses obviously don't export their production for the sake of diversity or cultural exchange, they do it because they have ""ascribed"" lesser wealth to another community and/or don't want to directly deal with the economic or environmental fallout of their capital venture.

Functionally, buying from Walmart and buying on Amazon are about the same.  The goods you get are at either place are made, for the most part, in other countries.   Which would be legit in an actually free market, until you consider our history of violence in global trade negotiation. 

Or most capital ventures, if you break them down.  However, buying from Amazon is one step further removed from having to confront the reality of economic inequality.    U don't have to go to the warehouse where the pay minimum wage yourself, and look into the eyes of the workers, and say to yourself, ""wow, I'm glad I don't work here"", and also, at the same time, ""geez this is really a steal, thank God for these low low prices. This is totally fine.""

Granted, even at Wal-Mart you don't get too see how your sausage is made.
But an Amazon purchase is even further removed you just click some buttons, there and in no time it is delivered to you in the comfort of your own home.  

Generally speaking, the more convenience you have, the harder someone else is working for you for less money.  Because of outsourcing and the economy that supports it, there is no chance for ""true cost"" economics.  And you can only live above your means for so long before you go bankrupt, and as a nation and add a global economy, that's where we are headed.

So no, the two places are not much different, but also Amazon is one step closer to poverty for everyone (even for the people in the Amazon sites, apparently) and is bad for our economy in the long run, and not just symbolically.  I'm not against capitalism, I'm just not okay with it as it stands"
646,AutoModerator,removecomment,2019-07-02 20:49:42,t1_esm8z85,"It seems like you're under the impression that these people just have this money lying around somewhere.

That's not how it works. The vast majority of this money *is* in the hands of other people, companies, etc. Because they don't have their wealth in money, they have it in *assets*. Most likely the majority in financial products like stocks (Bezos definitely does, no idea about Gates in detail).

Most of Bezos' wealth is in Amazon stocks, so not money, but something he can exchange for money. If he were to get rid of those, someone else would have to give up their money. Amazon could buy them (although since that would be a bit fishy, with him being the owner and all that, but ignoring that for a minute) which would mean Amazon would have *less* money to grow, employ people, etc.

Gates assets are more diversified, he only owns about 1% of Microsoft, and with the rest of the money, he did exactly what you suggest. He gave money to companies (in return for shares of those companies). That's literally the entire point of shares, companies sell a part of their company, a share, and take that money to finance their business. Although details are undisclosed, Gates most likely funds quite a lot of companies that way.

Just as a sidenote, this is called equity financing (instead of debt financing, taking out loans). You're selling what you have, so in this case, your company, or a portion of it. This isn't quite that literal, imagine it as the right to own a slice of a pie, but everyone who also owns the right to a slice of the pie has to agree on whether to eat it or sell it or throw it out or whatever.

Companies can raise money and control their shares. They can buyback shares, which for simplicities sake let's say just get destroyed, but since you then have less shares, and everybody who owns a share owns a larger part of the company, they get more valuable. You own a bigger part of the pie now. Or they can issue new shares, so go and sell smaller slices of the pie, which means of course that each slice will be a bit less valuable, but also that people who want a ""new"" slice will have to pay the company directly.

Oh, and not to mention, of course most of the time stock is not traded between people and the company, but between stockholders and other people.

Let's go back to Bezos. Another thing you suggest is that his wealth takes away from company money, taxes, wages, etc. That's not quite how it works.

Let's say you own a company, a lemonade stand. Let's say everything you need to operate that stand was gifted to you. You work for a while, make a profit, and eventually make enough to open a second stand. You still own both stands. Any costs are paid from the income your company makes selling lemonade.

This continues, your company grows, and because it grows and has more and more income, it becomes more valuable. You're still the owner of everything. Your lemonade business is eventually worth billions of dollars.

And since you own it, *you* are worth billions of dollars. That never required you to take any money out of the business, or really have your personal finances interact or influence company finances at all. You're simply rich because you own a valuable company (well, and apparently did a good job building a lemonade empire). Your wealth grew because the value of the company grew. And the value of the company grew because it sold a lot of lemonade."

Suppose you were choosing between purchasing the exact same product at the same price from your local Walmart or from Amazon. Buying it in person at Walmart drives up demand for Walmart's products and supports the employees who work there. But it also costs you time (and assuming you get there by driving also requires you to consume gasoline, emit CO2, put wear on your vehicle and the roads it travels on). If you buy it from Amazon, you can save that time and those resources (although having it delivered also consumes gasoline, wear on roads, emits CO2 but those costs are borne by Amazon). What do you do with that extra time is up to you, but what if you used all the extra time you saved buying from Amazon to do things that help support your local economy even more than shopping at Walmart?

For this reason, grocery stores knowingly will produce/order more than they'll sell with the idea being to make sure that they always have enough of everything for everyone. As to the efficiency of it all, is still efficient - you pay a premium at the grocery store in the form of higher prices in order to avoid having to call and place the order a week or so in advance.

Here's a thought experiment to help understand why this is hard to answer. Suppose you were choosing between purchasing the exact same product at the same price from your local Walmart or from Amazon. Buying it in person at Walmart drives up demand for Walmart's products and supports the employees who work there. But it also costs you time (and assuming you get there by driving also requires you to consume gasoline, emit CO2, put wear on your vehicle and the roads it travels on). If you buy it from Amazon, you can save that time and those resources (although having it delivered also consumes gasoline, wear on roads, emits CO2 but those costs are borne by Amazon). What do you do with that extra time is up to you, but what if you used all the extra time you saved buying from Amazon to do things that help support your local economy even more than shopping at Walmart? If that were the case, buying from Amazon would be ""better"" for your local economy.

I will also talk about government intervention in general, though depending on who you ask, not all of this counts as regulation.

The most simple example of good regulations are [Pigovian taxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigovian_tax). I won't describe them in detail here but the idea is that certain actions produce externalities (like pollution) which affect other people, and a tax puts a price on those externalities to discourage them. It is fairly easy to see that properly implementing such a Pigovian tax can lead to *everyone* in an economy being better off.

Another regulation where it is less obvious from a theoretical standpoint that it can be beneficial is a minimum wage. There are strong arguments for a minimum wage and there are cases where the data shows it works well in practice. You can read more on it in the /r/economics FAQ: https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/wiki/faq_minwage

And finally, for completeness, there are regulations that are commonly thought to be negative. Out of laziness, here is a link on the FAQ entry on trade: https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/wiki/faq_trade - tariffs for the purpose of protectionism usually are a bad thing.

Finally, it should be said that there are some people that say that *all* government intervention is a bad thing, but this is mostly based on non-economic arguments - for example you could argue that it is not moral for a government to intervene, or you could argue that maintaining a government that can impose and enforce regulations already costs more than the regulations will ever achieve.

Talking about it in general globally... In the past the buildings in the city center were usually old and it was cheaper to build new modern structures in the suburbs than renovate the old buildings in the city center, so it became unattractive for the fancy people and cheap.
 Artists and small start ups usually go to places where they can afford (cheap) but is not isolated so they can do their business. While in the past people with more money would rather live in the suburbs where it would be considered safer, cleaner and better financial investment. The poor people rather live near their jobs which are concentrated in the city center.

But then artists and start ups starts to succeed, become famous, brandy and so. Their life style in the old buildings architecture and in the city center becomes trendy, and others who want live near where there are artists and cultural stuff going on also look forwards live near them. So the city starts to attract fancy people and the prices go up.

But the worsening of all is the speculation that turns houses/property as not a place to live but a thing to hold while prices goes up and sell to cash in. For this reason there are many empty homes in major cities. Also rent the house to travellers becomes more attractive than rent to people who want live in it."

The way I think about it is it is about the right amount of regulation - like a game that needs rules to make the game work, but too many rules big it down. Ever seen that old commercial with 100 people trying to play tennis on the same court? It doesn’t work. That’s a deregulated market. It doesn’t work. 

Pros of deregulation CAN be lower barriers to entry which improves competition. But the flip side is that the deregulation can lead to monopolies, collusion among existing companies on the market that leads to artificial pricing and higher barriers to entry. Complete deregulation allows companies to offload negative externalities in society (dumping waste into public land, water, air, etc., hurting the population and depleting natural resources without having to pay for those side effects).  Deregulation can drive up economic disparities - if we were all on a desert island don’t you think the guy with 5X more stuff then everyone else would quickly be able to use his wealth coupled with everyone else’s need to survive to hoard wealth and gain 10X as much as everyone else?

Pros of a regulated market include consumer health and safety, worker protections, and requiring companies to pay for the negative effects they cause on all of us. 

The downside of regulation comes if it is heavy handed and not done correctly - barriers to entry become too high for new players, so there is no competition, which lets suppliers drive prices up. It can become too expensive for businesses to comply, which either drives up prices or constricts business that would otherwise grow."

No economist would make blanket statements about regulation in general being good or bad.

Markets don't always do everything they ""should"" on their own. One pretty important example right now are externalities. To be precise, the externalities of emissions. Externalities are costs incurred by parties who didn't chose to incur them. You didn't chose to incur the negative effects from the emissions of a factory on the other side of the world, yet you are affected by them. One possible solution to migitate that is to *make* the factory incur the cost, by for example putting a price on emissions that the factory has to pay. That's a ""good"" regulation, because it internalises the externality and makes the cost of a product reflect the actual cost of producing it more accurately.

Of course, there are ""bad"" regulations as well. Take for example rent control. The goal of rent control is usually to stabilise prices of rent controlled apartments. And indeed that's what rent control does. But it also leads to a laundry list of adverse effects. It discourages new housing from being build, it discourages landlords from maintaining their property, it leads to higher rent for adjacent property not under rent control, and other issues. Basically, it makes the underlying problem of a lack of supply worse, leads to other issues and only benefits a small group of people, and even those see some detrimental effects.

Then of course you have regulations that aren't necessarily efficient but are used for other reasons. Some countries for example have free colleges for everybody. That's not necessarily efficient because there *are* people who could afford to pay the ""full"" price but don't. You're giving them a free ride for no good reason (from an economics perspective). These countries still chose to have free college simply because they are fine with incurring that extra cost and basically just like it that way more, for one reason or another.

Besides all that, economics is mainly focused on looking bat what happens and what would happen if you do something (like implementing a regulation). It's not concerned with if what happens is good or bad, it just aims to understand and describe."

Very basic and dumb models say that you should produce x times the median demand with x > 1 as long as the salvage cost is greater than the cost of production.

726,AutoModerator,removecomment,2019-07-02 07:35:37,t1_esk6efa,"There is no single thing called a ""regulated market"". Some regulations make economic sense, others do not. I will also talk about government intervention in general, though depending on who you ask, not all of this counts as regulation.

The most simple example of good regulations are [Pigovian taxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigovian_tax). I won't describe them in detail here but the idea is that certain actions produce externalities (like pollution) which affect other people, and a tax puts a price on those externalities to discourage them. It is fairly easy to see that properly implementing such a Pigovian tax can lead to *everyone* in an economy being better off.

Another regulation where it is less obvious from a theoretical standpoint that it can be beneficial is a minimum wage. There are strong arguments for a minimum wage and there are cases where the data shows it works well in practice. You can read more on it in the /r/economics FAQ: https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/wiki/faq_minwage

And finally, for completeness, there are regulations that are commonly thought to be negative. Out of laziness, here is a link on the FAQ entry on trade: https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/wiki/faq_trade - tariffs for the purpose of protectionism usually are a bad thing.

Finally, it should be said that there are some people that say that *all* government intervention is a bad thing, but this is mostly based on non-economic arguments - for example you could argue that it is not moral for a government to intervene, or you could argue that maintaining a government that can impose and enforce regulations already costs more than the regulations will ever achieve. However this opinion is not mainstream."

Baked goods are cheap, and they don't last well either so you have to produce often, no one wants to shop at grocery stores that run out of bread, and regulatory requirements mean that unsold inventory is no longer profitable even if it's still edible.

A longer answer concerns things like [Economic Order Quantity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economicorderquantity.asp).  And although that math makes it looks neat and pretty, reliably estimating some of those variables like demanded quantity gets tough to do in practice.

The bigger societal problem with food waste is the stuff that winds up in dumpsters and garbage disposals instead of getting eaten; donating unsold goods isn't exactly ""waste"" per se.  They might actually be saving money by donating it instead of having to dispose of it, even without tax incentives or such."

Talking about it in general globally... In the past the buildings in the city center were usually old and it was cheaper to build new modern structures in the suburbs than renovate the old buildings in the city center, so it became unattractive for the fancy people and cheap.
 Artists and small start ups usually go to places where they can afford (cheap) but is not isolated so they can do their business. While in the past people with more money would rather live in the suburbs where it would be considered safer, cleaner and better financial investment. The poor people rather live near their jobs which are concentrated in the city center.

But then artists and start ups starts to succeed, become famous, brandy and so. Their life style in the old buildings architecture and in the city center becomes trendy, and others who want live near where there are artists and cultural stuff going on also look forwards live near them. So the city starts to attract fancy people and the prices go up.

But the worsening of all is the speculation that turns houses/property as not a place to live but a thing to hold while prices goes up and sell to cash in. For this reason there are many empty homes in major cities. Also rent the house to travellers becomes more attractive than rent to people who want live in it."

Then submitting the finishes document and with any other supplements they require. After this it goes to the editor and can be desk rejected, after this if it  is not desk rejected it goes to referees. The referees will read the paper over, make comments and decide to accept, reject, or request a revise and resubmit. If I recall the final call is the editor. Accepted and rejected is fairly obvious, The revise and resubmit means they want you to add or make changes based on questions and concerns of the referees.

Much of /u/celestia_keaton's question can be answered with a popularity/gentrification cycle (especially since they mention LA vs somewhere like the bay area where housing restrictions are huge).

I'm not an LA expert, but a lot of cities had a big white-flight starting in the 1950s and [LA was not immune](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/238429704_Escape_From_Los_Angeles_White_Flight_from_Los_Angeles_and_Its_Schools_1960-1980).  The wealthy fled to the suburbs.  Often the jobs eventually followed them (including places like Orange County).

A lot of those neighborhoods fell apart as people left, but over time, people wanted to come back.  The artists, often the childen of the white-flight suburbanites wanted the urban experience.  They couldn't afford the remaining nice areas in the city, so they chose the areas that weren't terrible but were still affordable.  As more of them moved in, the neighborhoods got safer and cooler.  

Now you have this cool neighborhood where all the artists are.  Restaurants/coffee shops open up there to serve them.  Non-artists come and visit.  Yuppies looking to save a buck move in too since it is now a cool neighborhood.  Maybe it doesn't have good schools, but that's years away for a young couple (or single person).

More of those people move in, the artists start to get priced out and move somewhere else.  Schools improve a bit and now people don't all leave when they have kids.  Now its not even an ""artsy"" neighborhood anymore, so ""squares"" all move in.  Prices keep going up.  If I have time later, I will edit this into a better comment rather than a stream of consciousness description...

TL;DR: White people with money leave, immigrants/minorities/poor people move in, artists need place to stay and want to be in the city so they start to move in, yuppies think it is cool to live near artists and follow, price goes up so artists leave, frat boys move in since it is now just a neighborhood with lots of nightlife."

In fact there's an entire model called Directed Technical Change (Acemoglu 1995) which is dedicated to explaining why both wages and supply of high skilled labour have been increasing in developed countries since the 1970s. And why technology has shifted from empowering low-skilled workers (e.g. spinning looms, containerisation, stuff affiliated with the Industrial Revolution) to empowering high-skilled workers (e.g. coding, quantum computers, financial modelling).

Focussing purely on labour supply and labour demand ignores the endogenous element of technology supply and technology demand. The more skilled labour there is, the stronger the bias will be on the production of skilled labour technology. Technology is a big misnomer here, it actually refers to Total Factor Productivity (TFP) which encompasses everything from industrial organisation, to education, to physical technology, to cultural attitudes.

Consequently, even if the same technology can be well diffused throughout the world (which it can't), then the effects of having more skilled labour depend on the flexibility of each individual economy, and any exogenous change in the proportion of high-skilled labour. For example, India is well known to suffer from systemic sclerosis, its organisations are incentivised to adopt labour-intensive processes because of the sheer amount of excess non-skilled labour. In contrast, places like China have just seen massive high-skilled labour booms resulting from exogenous (i.e. external to the model) education policies that are having dividends now as masses of STEM grads hit the labour market. Chinese firms are hence incentivised to adopt high-tech production methods, and that spurs demand for high tech labour which boosts wages.

It's also possible to think of the world as one gigantic economy (i.e. globalisation), in which case the result is similar. Global demand for high-skilled labour is increasing, as is supply. Over time, this should result in a clear divergence. In the extreme (i.e. if there are no rigidities or barriers whatsoever), then we should end up with a highly unequal world consisting of clusters of rich high-skilled regions and poor low-skilled regions. Each region is incentivised to prioritise technology growth in their own individual areas of advantage, but as a whole, the world is incentivised to produce high-skilled technology, so software engineers just become increasingly more well-paid."

The slope of the supply curve is typically positive because of the positive relationship between price and quantity of supply. When the price of a commodity increases, suppliers/sellers/producers have more incentive to ""supply"" more to the market. 

In relation to the demand curve, which has a negative slope due to the inverse relationship between the price and quantity demanded. 

Let's use hotdogs as an example. Think of the sale price of hotdogs. If the value of hotdogs were at 0, how much would you produce as a supplier? Probably none right? Because there is no profit to be made. What if the value of hotdogs was $50 each? Would you try to produce as much as possible? How much less would you produce if the value of hotdogs were $5? This relationship between how much you're willing to produce based on price is the supply curve.
*I use value and selling price interchangeably

The opposite is true of demand. If the price of hotdogs was 0, there would be unlimited demand. If the price was $50, the demand would probably not exist due to the existence of substitutes. But let's say there aren't any substitutes. What quantity of hotdogs are people willing to buy at $50 each? How about $25 each? 

Now, where the 2 curves intersect is commonly called the market equilibrium or equilibrium price. A point or minute range of prices where demand meets supply. Sellers sell X quantity at Y price and Buyers buy at X quantity at Y price. As a result, there should be less instances of shortages and surpluses.

It gets more complicated from here when you move into discussion about shprtage, surplus, elasticity, etc.

First of all we have to define ""value investing"".  Most people define value investing as an investment style that specifically targets assets that will generate NPV of cash flow in excess of its current value.  Value investors don't just by regular equities, though that seems to be what you are implying.    The main idea behind value investing is fundamental analysis, it is the underlying cash flow that determines value.  Value investors consider speculation to be purchasing an asset that has no cash flow (Gold, raw Land), or NPV of cash flow below current value (BYND probably) in the hopes that there will be a ""bigger fool"" that will buy the asset.  

&#x200B;

Now to address a few other things in your post that might demonstrate a lack of understanding in these things.  1. Buyouts are not rare, like at all.  Since I started investing in 1997, the number of listed companies has decreased by more than 50%, primarily due to consolidation.  I have personally invested in dozens of companies and worked for a few that were bought out. 2. A value investor should never be buying a company that has a better chance of bankruptcy than buyout, unless the tangible liquidation value is greater current asset price.  That is the point of understanding the cash flows and asset that underly the investment.  3. Dividends are not the only way to return cash to shareholders, and if a business can reinvest capital at a higher rate than individuals can deploy the capital, due to taxation of dividends, it is likely in the shareholder's interest for the company to reinvest cash flow in business growth.  Share buy backs.  

&#x200B;

Imagine two scenarios 1. you invest $10,000 in gold.  The only way you can make a profit is to sell your gold for more than the $10K.  2. You put $10K into 10% of your buddy's widget company.  You could possibly make your money back from the cash flow of the business, from the sale of the assets of the business, the whole buisness getting bought by someone else, or selling your specific shares to someone else.    The other big difference is you can look at how much cash flow your 10% of the business is, how likely it is to grow, ROA, ROE, ROIC, etc."

837,AutoModerator,removecomment,2019-06-30 17:10:56,t1_esf18av,"The supply curve in regards to demand and supply is one of 2 common curves, the other being the demand curve. 

The slope of the supply curve is typically positive because of the positive relationship between price and quantity of supply. When the price of a commodity increases, suppliers/sellers/producers have more incentive to ""supply"" more to the market. 

In relation to the demand curve, which has a negative slope due to the inverse relationship between the price and quantity demanded. 

Let's use hotdogs as an example. Think of the sale price of hotdogs. If the value of hotdogs were at 0, how much would you produce as a supplier? Probably none right? Because there is no profit to be made. What if the value of hotdogs was $50 each? Would you try to produce as much as possible? How much less would you produce if the value of hotdogs were $5? This relationship between how much you're willing to produce based on price is the supply curve.
*I use value and selling price interchangeably

The opposite is true of demand. If the price of hotdogs was 0, there would be unlimited demand. If the price was $50, the demand would probably not exist due to the existence of substitutes. But let's say there aren't any substitutes. What quantity of hotdogs are people willing to buy at $50 each? How about $25 each? 

Now, where the 2 curves intersect is commonly called the market equilibrium or equilibrium price. A point or minute range of prices where demand meets supply. Sellers sell X quantity at Y price and Buyers buy at X quantity at Y price. As a result, there should be less instances of shortages and surpluses.

It gets more complicated from here when you move into discussion about shprtage, surplus, elasticity, etc.

Lmao nevermind. Wrong curve haha. Top comment explained it well."

There has been much more PR done lately by mining companies reaching out to show the public what they have going on that may have been unknown by the public/communities. 

For the reports, If it is a mine or company that does business with a mine (a contractor), use MSHAs website

[www.msha.gov](www.msha.gov) 

You will find links to search for the various reports you are looking for, and the search functionality is pretty straightforward.

I will say though as someone with significant experience in this department, what MSHA reports is definitely not the best way to look at how these places are doing safety wise. As an  enforcement agency, they do most anything they can do to justify their existence by making things sound worse then they are. 

For example, your search on the MSHA website will yield all violations the company received in a certain time period which will include the law that was violated and the cost of the citation, but they will not provide you the actual body of the citation (the details of who/what/where/why) unless you file for a FOIA request. Why this is important is that if you actually have read some of these citations (even the $thousand ones) you would be surprised what they are actually writing citations on and calling “significant” safety violations, and getting away with."

850,AutoModerator,removecomment,2019-06-30 11:47:31,t1_esee8pr,"Capitalism is unique in that it has these three tendencies working as one (according to the Marxist David Harvey):

1. In order to develop society with greater access to a wider range of goods and services, the economy must trend towards a positive growth rate. If total value in a capitalist political economy stagnates, prices go up and access to goods and services becomes more difficult. Economies are often measured in GDP, the percent rate of increase in gross domestic product, not net worth.

2. Value is added to the total system through a mode of production in which labor that produces more value than the total cost of production is transformed into a surplus value. Thus, there is always a gap between what labor gets (wages) and what it creates. Although profit can be produced by many means, value can be added to the total economic system only through labor (and natural resources, depending on your definition of an economy).  This mode of production requires a bunch of laws and therefore institutions that uphold private property rights.

3. In order to make the production process more efficient, there tends to be a reliance on increasing technological innovation. In higher education, we like to replace faculty with online courses (such as a university’s plan to work with 2U) and replace administrative tasks with automated software. This tendency can also be observed in the supply chain for the required tools of higher education; the production of computers, food, lab equipment, and facilities increasingly relies on automated procedures and mechanical processes.

Many economic epochs had one or two of those things, but not all three."

In general, the first step is picking which journals to submit to, this shouldn't be too hard as the obvious first ones to consider are journals of papers you have or will cite. Then submitting the finishes document and with any other supplements they require. After this it goes to the editor and can be desk rejected, after this if it  is not desk rejected it goes to referees. The referees will read the paper over, make comments and decide to accept, reject, or request a revise and resubmit. If I recall the final call is the editor. Accepted and rejected is fairly obvious, The revise and resubmit means they want you to add or make changes based on questions and concerns of the referees.

First of all we have to define ""value investing"".  Most people define value investing as an investment style that specifically targets assets that will generate NPV of cash flow in excess of its current value.  Value investors don't just by regular equities, though that seems to be what you are implying.    The main idea behind value investing is fundamental analysis, it is the underlying cash flow that determines value.  Value investors consider speculation to be purchasing an asset that has no cash flow (Gold, raw Land), or NPV of cash flow below current value (BYND probably) in the hopes that there will be a ""bigger fool"" that will buy the asset.  

&#x200B;

Now to address a few other things in your post that might demonstrate a lack of understanding in these things.  1. Buyouts are not rare, like at all.  Since I started investing in 1997, the number of listed companies has decreased by more than 50%, primarily due to consolidation.  I have personally invested in dozens of companies and worked for a few that were bought out. 2. A value investor should never be buying a company that has a better chance of bankruptcy than buyout, unless the tangible liquidation value is greater current asset price.  That is the point of understanding the cash flows and asset that underly the investment.  3. Dividends are not the only way to return cash to shareholders, and if a business can reinvest capital at a higher rate than individuals can deploy the capital, due to taxation of dividends, it is likely in the shareholder's interest for the company to reinvest cash flow in business growth.  Share buy backs.  

&#x200B;

Imagine two scenarios 1. you invest $10,000 in gold.  The only way you can make a profit is to sell your gold for more than the $10K.  2. You put $10K into 10% of your buddy's widget company.  You could possibly make your money back from the cash flow of the business, from the sale of the assets of the business, the whole buisness getting bought by someone else, or selling your specific shares to someone else.    The other big difference is you can look at how much cash flow your 10% of the business is, how likely it is to grow, ROA, ROE, ROIC, etc."

Proponents of UBI say its a much better way of ensuring people get some minimum level of benefit than welfare. The reason is because of [welfare traps.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare_trap) Essentially, because welfare takes so long to get approved for, and because it is revoked when you get any employment, there is an incentive to refuse some forms of employment that are offered to you while on welfare. You wouldn't take a part-time job unless it paid you more than your welfare, and if you thought the job was seasonal you would just stay on welfare. UBI gets rid of this perverse incentive by paying you a fixed stipend regardless of your employment status. Even some free-market economists have proposed a form of UBI. Look at Milton Friedman's [negative income tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_income_tax).

A tax cut by definition only affects those that are paying taxes. This is not necessarily a bad thing, as people and corporations who pay taxes are productive members of society. When taxes are cut people have more disposable income. People either save this disposable income or spend it. When they spend it, it goes directly back into the economy as consumption. And because one person's spending is another person's income a chain reaction occurs that raises everyone's income. This is called the [multiplier effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplier_(economics)). When they save it get injected back into the economy in the form of investment. Generally this goes out in the form of new loans, which lowers interest rates and/or makes funding available to projects that wouldn't have otherwise had it. Or it can go into capital investment like purchasing stock. High stock prices provide a return on investment for shareholders which they can either spend or save. In addition, the shareholder returns attract new competitors and provide a funding source for company acquisitions. Acquisitions are good for innovation because they provide a funding source (exit) for startups.

The argument of which one is better is not an easy one to answer. Similar arguments to this one pop up in policy debate all the time. We call this debate [supply side](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply-side_economics) and [demand side](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand-side_economics) economics. Instead of giving you my view, let me show you how you would evaluate what questions you need to ask to determine which policy has more merit. The first thing we need to do is list all the potential consequences of both actions (good or bad) and then later on assign a weight to it.

**UBI:**

* Removes welfare trap (+)
* Helps low income families, reducing [externalities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality) like crime (+)
* Would likely raise inflation (-)
* Reduces administrative burden of social programs (+)

**Tax cuts**

* Reduces [deadweight loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excess_burden_of_taxation) (+)
* Results in more investment (+)
* Result in more consumption (+)
* Would likely raise inflation (-)
* Lowers government revenues (-)

UBI: Alright, so now we need to figure out the tangible benefit of removing the welfare trap, lowering externalities and the reduced admin burden and see if that outweighs the cost of inflation. Since more people are adding value in the economy, people are removed from low-value admin, and less crime is being committed, any potential inflation should be countered from the increased output through this policy. Its important that we did this, because a lot of Government spending is inflationary. Its inflationary when the benefit to society is less than the cost of implementing the policy and has a real negative multiplier. See [broken window fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_broken_window).

Tax cuts: alright, so does the improvement in projects funded, increased investment and increased consumption make up for the potentially higher inflation and lost government revenues? Well since more output is being produced by new projects, more projects are being funded with lending and IPOs, and stock prices are going up this should counteract the inflationary forces. Now we have to determine was the money better off in the hands of the government or the hands of the people. Generally the money is better spent in the hands of the people, because it is easier for people to find value-added projects in millions of small microcosms than for the central government to manage changes in these small communities. However, infrastructure investments are also essential to the strength of the economy. To solve this last question we need to study the effectiveness of 1 dollar of government spending vs. 1 dollar of private sector spending and determine which spending has the higher economic output. Once we solve this question then we will have a factual basis to form our opinions.

It should be noted, you could probably have some combination of both tax cuts and UBI to maximize efficiency. It doesn't have to be one or the other. This process is also iterative. I may have forgotten an effect, made an assumption, or maybe the variables change or are not linear ie: [laffer curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laffer_curve). This is not a static model, which is why we need to test our hypothesis through regression in multiple markets over multiple time periods to become confident in the answers. This is why you shouldn't take one economic study too seriously if you see them in the news. There are many variables to control for, and its impossible for one study to prove an economic relationship."

Maybe annuity-like structures to remove cash (like I pay you $10m today, you pay my property taxes for the next 20 years).  People would just structure assets and income to avoid the cap.

If you define it as total value of all assets (property, present value of annuities, etc.)...honestly, probably still not much.  There aren't really that many people with $100m.  Ignoring the problems with this (like...what if you are the founder of AirBNB? Your ownership is certainly worth more than $100m, but there's no ""official"" value and you can't exactly extract that value), there just aren't enough people it would hurt for it to matter.

Maybe you'd see slightly less economic growth.  Company founders don't need to work as hard once they hit this limit.  They just need to keep increasing value equal to what they spend on consumption, but they don't need to grow their $100m company into a $500m company.  Probably see less investment in entrepreneurship.  A lot of early funding comes from really rich people who can afford to invest in risky ideas...with the cap, you have to be careful.

But would Google still exist?  Probably.  Even if Page and Brin capped out at $100m, plenty of other smart people would want to use it as a vehicle to generate their fortunes.  And many people who hit the $100m amount would be happy to keep working to keep up with their spending.  Even if your total savings are limited, you can figure out lots of ways to spend that money...hire private jet pilots, fuel up your yacht, etc."

It absolutely does not matter *at all* who pays the tax on paper. Tax incidence is determined by the elasticity of supply/demand.

Unsurprisingly, the elasticity for tobacco demand is very low. It's simple, tobacco is super addictive. The *entire* tax burden of tobacco falls on consumers. And not only that, they even pay more *beyond* the tax burden. In simpler terms, because people who buy tobacco want it so badly, they accept any price increase, and the tax burden lies entirely on them, no matter who pays it on paper.

Of course, that's an extreme scenario, but for many goods, the elasticity of supply/demand is such that the tax burden is shifted to consumers to at least some degree. So yes, the company might lose a bit of profit, but prices still go up, because the tax burden lies on both the company *and* the consumer."

If you're looking to go to school to reach a specific checkpoint, you should go to a technical college that grants a certification upon graduation.  When you graduate from college, you still have to deal with entry level jobs requiring 3-5 years experience to get hired.    Having a certification, supercedes that requirement and directly qualifies you for specific jobs.        

Think about the difference between a bachelors in Business and an MBA.  The answer should be clear.   That said, you could get by with a Business Economics major if you're focused on starting up your own business or being an entrepreneur.


Sorry, forgot to answer your questions.  Yes, an economics degree is one of a few degrees that secures higher paying jobs on average.  Can't promise a specific number for you though ANDDDD  an economics degree doesn't teach you how to secure a job anyway.  Just because you COULD make that money doesn't mean that you're guaranteed to make it.       

And Economics majors being among the most unemployed is sorta tied to the fact that... there aren't really jobs specifically tailored for economists.  Economics is a very, surprisingly complicated field.  A LOT of people have opinions about the economy, but don't really understand that nature of the beast in the first place and, on top of that, people don't necessarily take the advice of economists.  Those jobs are delegated to finance and accountants.   Add to that that we live in a short-term, supply-side disasterole (disaster + casserole) economy where no one is thinking about the mid or the long term, and you have a labor market that has little place for economics majors.   Our options are to either become professors, join a think-tank, enter the business world and settle for basic bitch, inefficient, bottom-line thought on how to accumulate wealth or find a job in a different field.       

Economics is a very hard soft science.  We have graphs and statistical models that show how things should be, but the problem is that the models are based on people making the correct actions and approaching issues logically or with virtue.  There's always an excuse to pay people less, but the excuses/reasons for paying people more are much more sparse.  Logically, if people can pay their bills and not be so fucking stressed out from day to day, they could provide more tax revenue, they could use their disposable income they have to boost profits for businesses and shit, they could pay their bills and no have the company miss out on their earnings projections.   ... But because the general public is so mindless about economics, they only see the first step of having to pay money and they think that that's the only thing that happens... and that it's horrific.   They've bought into the old wive's tales that they've heard about money.  ""Well shit, if they have to pay people more, that'll make the business suffer and go over and then EVERYONE WILL BE FUCKED!  So let's do nothing!""  A blind man could see that we've done our best to exterminate the middle class, but people don't understand that a healthy, vibrant economy has a healthy middle class....  because fuck, why doesn't it make sense to have >50% of your population solvent and comfortable.       

The reason you should pursue more than just a bachelor's, if you love Economics, is because people actually don't understand the logic behind what I just said.  Like, I've watched people's eyes glaze over as I start showing them the actual vast unexplored terrain of what you actually do with fucking money and what it's supposed to do, because they either didn't realize that there's more to economics than ""money in, money out"" or because it was like I presenting some completely alien object to them that disgusts them.       


Point is.  Very few people respect economists because they don't understand it.  The amount of those people that are in charge for building a business, let alone, hiring people is few and far between.    If you want to use your degree, don't settle for basic bullshit.  There are gonna be plenty of people with economics degrees.  Not many will have a Masters, let alone a PhD.      

Frankly, you need to ask yourself why you chose the major.  Is it because you want to devote your time to it?  Or is it simply because you want to understand the world better.  If it's the latter, your question is irrelevant.  If it's the form, the answer is no."

* Speak up and ask/answer questions in your classes. Professors are more likely to agree to research assistanceships if they know who you are, and the best way for that to happen is to participate during lectures as much as possible. Even if it's just asking clarifying questions for your own understanding, be an active participant in classes.
* Look at data and learn how to explore it. A lot of economics research is finding and manipulating data in a way that reveals information about it. Go and download datasets from any public data set (Bureau of Labour Statistics, ACS, IPUMS, OECD website, Statistics Canada, Eurostat, etc) and just start to play with it. Gain some experience with R or Stata and learn the basic functions of some of those libraries.
* Learn about your professors research. A lot of them are probably working on projects that you aren't hearing about in class, even if you aren't actively seeking to work with a particular professor, ask them about their research to at least learn what's possible and what you might find interesting.

I find that a lot of professors especially appreciate assistants with good programming skills, so learning some basic R (including how to use the dplyr and ggplot packages) and even a bit of Python could be helpful."

It really comes down to the fact that portfolio returns are formed by a (weighted) arithmetic mean while portfolio variance *also* depends on correlations between portfolio elements; you can see the standard *n*\-asset formulas [on the Modern portfolio theory wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory).

Let's imagine you have 2 assets (A and B) in your portfolio of $100, each representing a 50% or $50 weighting.  
Asset A has an expected return (time period doesn't matter as long as we're consistent) of 5%, and a standard deviation of 25%, while asset B has an expected return of 10%, and a standard deviation of 40%.  
The correlation coefficient between the two is 0.3.

With this, your portfolio expected return is (5% + 10%)/2 = 7.5%; makes sense - an average of two evenly weighted assets linearly interpolates their returns.  
But, your portfolio variance is (0.5\^2 \* 0.25\^2) + (0.5\^2 \* 0.4\^2) + (0.5 \* 0.5 \* 0.25 \* 0.4 \*  0.3) = 6.3%, which equates to a 25.1% standard deviation.

Pretty clear if we compare to asset A, we've increased returns by half with a negligible increase in risk - there are also many measures we can use to show improvements like this occurred, such as the [Sharpe ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharpe_ratio).

Note that this improvement hinges on the correlation coefficient - in general, the lower an asset's correlation to your existing portfolio the more effectively it will allow you to diversify (consider if our correlation was negative - the third term in our portfolio variance would be negative as well!). This is why you cannot diversify systematic risk - as your portfolio grows it becomes impossible to find *any* asset which will be uncorrelated with your portfolio, because all assets reflect some kind of underlying trend. To think about this, consider if you owned a piece of every single asset in all markets across the world; if a systematic shock hits like a violent alien invasion, your diversified portfolio will still suffer as every asset class and market is exposed - this is a 'limit' on finding uncorrelated stocks.

(Side note: this 'limit' is more significantly true in *theory* than in practice, as we do not have the true correlations between assets, only our best approximations from sample data. This is why diversification strategies will often be justified in logical as well as mathematical terms, because the example I used in this comment falls apart if our estimate of the correlation coefficient \[0.3\] is far from the true value.)"

I’m getting my masters but I also had no trouble finding temporary summer work as a data analyst. And before I settled on the masters program I had several full time job offers I turned down. 

None is us were offered less than 50k, in Ohio. Entry level, minimal experience for most of my friends. I’d venture to guess those unemployed Econ majors are not that creative with selling themselves. Economics teaches you great critical thinking (or at least my program did) which is highly beneficial for many paths, especially if you pick up some data skills."

How do you know that the market will under invest in things that do not have the benefits to society internalized.  Are you so hubristic to think you know better than millions of individual people making their own decisions?

Famously, the government (& let's include lobbyists and crony capitalists) who think they know better, are perfectly adept at choosing losers and never the winners!

I wonder if people like you can't stand the idea that self-interested individuals will take risks to create wealth and efficiencies by innovating and that this will ultimately serve society.  Just look around you."
