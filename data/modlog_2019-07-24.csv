&#x200B;

One thing Milton said is that

&#x200B;

>**There is no such thing as different schools of economics; there is only good economics and bad economics.**

&#x200B;

So more generally Milton believed strongly in what is now called ""mainstream microeconomics."" If you look at one of his main works, Capitalism and Freedom, it is strongly based upon what you'll find in any standard intermediate microeconomics textbook (except the portions that deal with macroeconomics, of course).

&#x200B;

So here are some of the main differences,

&#x200B;

1. Milton put a \*lot\* more emphasis than austrians would on economics as an engine of analysis to create scientific predictions that could then be tested. He wrote a lot about this in his essay on positive economics, found [here.](http://kimoon.co.kr/gmi/reading/friedman-1966.pdf)  (this is a mainstream view)
2. [Milton does not believe in the Austrian Business Cycle Theory](https://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/01/milton_friedman.html). He generally thinks the view of business cycles as a boom followed by a bust is wrong [(as shown by his plucking theory here:)](https://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/01/new_support_for.html) If you are not aware the Austrian theory roughly states that easy money causes mal-investment which leads to a boom and then a bust. This theory has not held up well to the data.
3. Friedman does not define inflation as an increase in the money supply. [Rather he sees inflation as an \*effect\* of increasing the money supply.](https://files.stlouisfed.org/files/htdocs/publications/es/07/ES0701.pdf) (This is a mainstream view).

The only real similarity is that Friedman had a large faith in markets, and skepticism in government regulation, that the Austrians share. Some austrians also share his affinity for Adam Smith (not murray rothbard, however). This is kinda like saying that flat-earthers and physicists both agree that gravity is a good thing, it really doesn't tell you much about either of them.

&#x200B;

So if you want to walk in Milton's shoes I would highly recommend picking up a principles textbook and cranking away at some reading and practice problems. If you get good enough and take some really hard math you can get into some of the stuff he learned as a graduate student in the forthcoming Chicago Price Theory textbook that is coming out in [September.](https://home.uchicago.edu/cbm4/cpt/)"

First off, the field of [computational economics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_economics) is a thing. However, it mostly is concerned with microeconomic problems that can easily be classified as “algorithmic game theory” (eg how to efficiently determine the winner of an auction). While that’s not all that’s popular in the field, that’s primarily what it is. So this might not be helpful, but I wanted to at least mention it. EDIT: actually, if you poke around that Wikipedia page enough, but might find something to help you. 

Second, what you’re looking for is going to be resources about [Method of Simulated Moments](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_simulated_moments), [Indirect Inference](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirect_inference), and other such Econometric methods used for Structural Modeling and Computation. Now, these methods are used for estimating parameters of complex models where the parameters can’t be estimated using some kind of regression model or data is only available in aggregated form. Obviously the properties of these estimators are not what you’re concerned with. However, in order to implement these estimators, the following procedure is used: 1) guess parameters, 2) simulate the model, 3) compare the simulated data to the observed/aggregated data, 4) change the parameters you guessed and repeat until you match the simulated data to the observed data. As such, resources for implementing these estimators **should** cover aspects about how to efficiently simulate the model.  

I bolded “should” because in actuality, there are very few good resources for this area of economics. I’ve taken some classes in the area, and I can confirm that there’s basically [one textbook available](https://www.amazon.com/Simulation-Based-Econometric-Methods-CORE-Lecture/dp/0198774753) and it’s not the best. I mean, simply viewing the two Wikipedia pages I included should give you a feel for how (un)popular of an area this is. (However, it is becoming more popular now that even cheap computers can run estimations of simple models). So unfortunately, the best I can tell you is good luck, and I hope I’ve given you enough keywords to help with your search. I believe u/ECTD is working on a dissertation right now that either uses these techniques or is researching them, so he/she might be able to give you some better resources."

In the ""short run,"" new firms cannot enter, and firms can make a profit; in the ""long run,"" firms can enter, and the price adjusts until entrant firms cannot make a profit.

If that's what you're talking about, I would only partly agree with your assessment.  You can see some differences between the ""short"" vs ""long"" run -- in the short run, the market has an upward-sloping supply curve, whereas in the long run (or more precisely, given enough time for new firms to enter the market), the supply curve is horizontal, with the price dictated by the marginal cost at the efficient scale of production.

But saying that the main take-away is the long vs short run dichotomy -- I'd argue that's a confusing way to think about it.  How long is the short run?  When does it become the long run?  The thing is, the definitions of ""short"" and ""long"" run depend on what we're talking about.  Here, the difference is that it takes time for new firms to enter the market.  We define the ""short run"" as the time until that happens, and we define the ""long run"" to be the time after that has happened.

There are short-run and long-run distinctions in other places, too.  For instance, we might talk about ""short"" and ""long"" runs when discussing a firm's production function.  It typically takes time for a firm to expand its capacity -- to get more equipment, etc.  We can define the [""short run"" for production](https://opentextbc.ca/principlesofeconomics2eopenstax/chapter/production-in-the-short-run/) to be the time scale at which one input (usually ""capital"" or ""capacity"") is held fixed.  In other words, the time until the firm can get more equipment is called the short run, and the time after that is called the long run.

In the short run, a firm can still increase output by hiring more labor, but it is likely to face diminishing returns (and therefore increasing marginal and average costs) because it is trying to produce more output than its capacity was meant for.  But given enough time, it can expand its capacity and produce efficiently at the new scale.

However, note that we are defining the short and long run to be the time until something happens.  In one case (competitive markets), the long run means however long it takes for the entry of new firms to fully erode profits.  How long does that take?  Depends on the market, hard to say in advance.  In the other case (production), the long run means however long it takes this firm to change its capacity to produce the new quantity at peak efficiency.  How long does this take?  Probably depends on the firm.  

--  -- 

So -- main take-aways.  I would say the following:

1)  The long vs short run distinction is important but tricky.  Some things are qualitatively different if you look at what happens immediately after a change, vs what happens once they have had time to adjust.  The ""long run"" means however long it takes to adjust, which is context-dependent.  I think I agree with you, but also think it's important to clarify.

2)  If I understand which model you are referring to -- that model also describes the simplest possible kind of market structure (or maybe second-simplest, after pure monopoly) -- namely, perfect competition.  There are many identical firms, they all sell exactly the same product, new firms can freely enter and old firms can freely exit, and no firm has any ability to affect the market price.  For some markets (if there are many firms whose products are very good substitutes for one another), this is a good approximation.  However, many markets are trickier than this -- for instance, the firms sell slightly different products, or they can choose what products to sell, or where to locate.  Very often, firms have some ability to affect the price they sell at, though charging a different price can affect how much you are able to sell.  These econ-101 models are some use, but don't give you a comprehensive understanding of the economy.  If you are interested in the study of other kinds of markets for goods or services, including actual real-world markets, the field that studies this is a branch of economics called Industrial Organization."

First, selfishness vs. selflessness -- that's a trait that's hardwired since the earliest days of not just human evolution, but any animal evolution.  You're fighting a billion + years of evolution there.

Second, even if everybody was purely selfless, there's the idea of awareness of one's needs.   Imagine you were responsible for buying everything (rent, food, clothes, gas, even vacations) for somebody on the other side of the world, and they were responsible for doing the same for you -- well, just imagine how that'd work out.  However, this idea would really only apply in a very pure-communist society (rather than a the softer ""socialist"" idea).

Most of all though, you'd be fighting against raw statistics coupled with an increasing return on investment for being ""selfish"" as fewer and fewer people were taking advantage of ""selfish"" opportunities.  Imagine whatever percentage of the world right now is virtuous in the way you describe.  It could be 1%,  10%, even 50% -- the number now doesn't matter so much.  But then imagine trying to get everybody to be that way.  Even if you got 99%, that remaining 1% of selfish minded people would then be left with a wide, ripe field of opportunities to be selfish.

For example, let's imagine 99% of landlords had a collective-change-of-heart and agreed to just charge the rent they need to make a marginal profit.  That remaining 1% of landlords would be making money faster than the rest, thus buying up more property than the rest, and slowly but surely (or not so slowly) that 1% of landlords would be owning an ever-increasing share of property.  The less people there are ""playing in the selfish game"", the better the deal would be for those playing it.  So, as you got closer and closer to 100% of people being selfless, there's greater and greater incentive for people to decide not to be, or to even switch back to being selfish.   And getting 100% to do it is so extremely unlikely that it's effectively impossible."

You're absolutely right there. Unless the government in surplus and has no debts (which never happens), a dollar taxed from the economy is always spent back into it.

Of course, the economy isn't about money. Money is just the medium of exchange: it's how we organise the production and distribution of goods and services. What's important is where the money's going.

Suppose the government starts taxing money to spend on building bridges. Now, bridges aren't just spent into existence. It takes up a lot of resources to build a bridge, and the more resources are used up on bridges, the fewer are left over for firms that produce non-bridge-related goods and services, who are footing the bill for it all. Because less is available to them, there's less 'room' for them to grow, and they might have to decrease production and lay off employees to avoid going out of business.

Secondly, a higher saving rate will lead to a higher capital stock whuch will lead to more economic growth and more consumption per capita (despite initially saving more!)

Like zzzzz94 said though, a higher saving rate has a level effect. It will temporarily increase the growth rate of output and consumption per capita, but at a certain moment its effect on growth will wear off."

47,AutoModerator,removecomment,2019-07-23 19:00:18,t1_eulwfug,"Are you talking about [perfectly competitive markets](https://dornsifecms.usc.edu/assets/sites/1277/docs/week_8_Competitive_Supply.pdf) where firms are price takers?  In the ""short run,"" new firms cannot enter, and firms can make a profit; in the ""long run,"" firms can enter, and the price adjusts until entrant firms cannot make a profit.

If that's what you're talking about, I would only partly agree with your assessment.  You can see some differences between the ""short"" vs ""long"" run -- in the short run, the market has an upward-sloping supply curve, whereas in the long run (or more precisely, given enough time for new firms to enter the market), the supply curve is horizontal, with the price dictated by the marginal cost at the efficient scale of production.

But saying that the main take-away is the long vs short run dichotomy -- I'd argue that's a confusing way to think about it.  How long is the short run?  When does it become the long run?  The thing is, the definitions of ""short"" and ""long"" run depend on what we're talking about.  Here, the difference is that it takes time for new firms to enter the market.  We define the ""short run"" as the time until that happens, and we define the ""long run"" to be the time after that has happened.

There are short-run and long-run distinctions in other places, too.  For instance, we might talk about ""short"" and ""long"" runs when discussing a firm's production function.  It typically takes time for a firm to expand its capacity -- to get more equipment, etc.  We can define the [""short run"" for production](https://opentextbc.ca/principlesofeconomics2eopenstax/chapter/production-in-the-short-run/) to be the time scale at which one input (usually ""capital"" or ""capacity"") is held fixed.  In other words, the time until the firm can get more equipment is called the short run, and the time after that is called the long run.

In the short run, a firm can still increase output by hiring more labor, but it is likely to face diminishing returns (and therefore increasing marginal and average costs) because it is trying to produce more output than its capacity was meant for.  But given enough time, it can expand its capacity and produce efficiently at the new scale.

However, note that we are defining the short and long run to be the time until something happens.  In one case (competitive markets), the long run means however long it takes for the entry of new firms to fully erode profits.  How long does that take?  Depends on the market, hard to say in advance.  In the other case (production), the long run means however long it takes this firm to change its capacity to produce the new quantity at peak efficiency.  How long does this take?  Probably depends on the firm.  

--  -- 

So -- main take-aways.  I would say the following:

1)  The long vs short run distinction is important but tricky.  Some things are qualitatively different if you look at what happens immediately after a change, vs what happens once they have had time to adjust.  The ""long run"" means however long it takes to adjust, which is context-dependent.  I think I agree with you, but also think it's important to clarify.

2)  If I understand which model you are referring to -- that model also describes the simplest possible kind of market structure (or maybe second-simplest, after pure monopoly) -- namely, perfect competition.  There are many identical firms, they all sell exactly the same product, new firms can freely enter and old firms can freely exit, and no firm has any ability to affect the market price.  For some markets (if there are many firms whose products are very good substitutes for one another), this is a good approximation.  However, many markets are trickier than this -- for instance, the firms sell slightly different products, or they can choose what products to sell, or where to locate.  Very often, firms have some ability to affect the price they sell at, though charging a different price can affect how much you are able to sell.  These econ-101 models are some use, but don't give you a comprehensive understanding of the economy.  If you are interested in the study of other kinds of markets for goods or services, including actual real-world markets, the field that studies this is a branch of economics called Industrial Organization."

firstly, economists probably use criteria other than just the wider economy when they choose a party to support (i hope). also i am not sure the author is being fair with the way he is asigning policies to parties, but i didnt click any links.

the second and third arguments present a series of correlations, but no clear establishment of any causation. it could be that democrats are recieving a growing economy and they ruin it just in time for the republicans to take over, for example. the author would need to point to specific policies, show theoretically how they would affect the economy and then support his theory with empirical data.

There's ""Microeconomic Analysis"" by Varian; ""Advanced Microeconomic Theory"" by Jehle and Reny; and the big daddy, staple of PhD Micro, ""Microeconomic Theory"" by Mas-Colell, Whinston and Green.

The macro books I was assigned in grad school are ""Recursive Methods in Economic Dynamics"" by Stokey and Lucas, and ""Recursive Macroeconomic Theory"" by Ljungqvist and Sargent.  

For math, you need enough to follow along in these books.  You can learn some math from the books themselves, or while reading through them.  I was assigned ""Mathematics for Economists"" by Simon and Blume, and ""Optimization in Economic Theory"" by Dixit, as well as ""Statistical Inference"" by Casella and Berger"" to prepare for econometrics.

If you're still taking classes, look for math department courses in multivariable calculus and linear algebra.  (Actually, I'm not sure how that works at your university.  In most US universities, undergrads can sign up for undergrad-level classes in any department, before or after declaring a major; and grad students can often take classes in other departments with the approval of faculty in both their own department and the one they want to take classes in.)  It doesn't hurt to take differential equations, but it's not essential.  You will want some exposure to mathematical proofs and reasoning from definitions and axioms.  Some linear algebra classes are taught that way, while others emphasize calculations.  Real analysis is always proof-based -- it's sort of the attempt to construct a fully rigorous foundation for calculus, which also introduces concepts useful in other fields of math.  PhD programs in economics often have real analysis as a prerequisite -- the actual concepts and theorems are occasionally useful, and familiarity with that style of mathematical thinking is indispensable if you want to understand economic theory.  (Don't be fooled by the name -- ""real analysis"" is not about analyzing data, and the ""real"" contrasts with ""complex"" analysis rather than ""fake"" analysis.)

If taking math classes is impractical, you can try asking for textbook recommendations in those fields.  I was assigned ""Principles of Mathematical Analysis"" by Rudin as my real analysis textbook, which is popular in top math departments and pairs with a graduate-level textbook on analysis, but can be tough to read as your only resource."

A state owned telecom company can invest in the infrastructure because it can be allowed to be a monopoly (the government let's it happen for a while so the company can make their profits and after a period it makes sure that other companies can also enter the market which increases the profitability and investments overall because of higher competition) and the state has funds to help out with the investment needed.

Glancing at some of this guy's writings, my first impression was that they seem to confuse more than they elucidate.  For instance, [the title of this post is true](http://elliswinningham.net/index.php/2019/02/05/the-budget-deficit-and-the-national-debt-not-the-same-thing/), but not in the least bit heterodox, and the text does the usual MMT thing of mixing sense with nonsense, occasionally justifying the sense, and mischaracterizing the mainstream view.  One example of the latter is the quote from Kalecki about confusing stocks and flows.  I don't know how Kalecki was taught, but I was taught the distinction between annual deficits and debts in Econ 101.

As for the nonsense, you've probably seen the stuff about money creation, taxation etc. in the subs you linked, and the independence of the Fed from Congress, etc.  They say it better than I could.

To Winningham's credit, though -- in that one post, he does state clearly the premise that the government creates money and, by deficit spending, enriches the public.  I'm skeptical that it works that way, but I've gotten the impression that this is the main claim of MMT, and he doesn't equivocate in saying it."

You're absolutely right there. Unless the government in surplus and has no debts (which never happens), a dollar taxed from the economy is always spent back into it.

Of course, the economy isn't about money. Money is just the medium of exchange: it's how we organise the production and distribution of goods and services. What's important is where the money's going.

Suppose the government starts taxing money to spend on building bridges. Now, bridges aren't just spent into existence. It takes up a lot of resources to build a bridge, and the more resources are used up on bridges, the fewer are left over for firms that produce non-bridge-related goods and services, who are footing the bill for it all. Because less is available to them, there's less 'room' for them to grow, and they might have to decrease production and lay off employees to avoid going out of business.

Of course, you don't have to actually take anyone out of anyone's pocket for this to occur. It doesn't matter whether or not you're covering the cost of the bridges with tax money: either way, bridges don't build themselves. In a sense, the 'real' tax is the spending itself."

I think you're a bit confused with terminology. It sounds to me like the ""private"" and ""public"" companies you're hearing about aren't ""public=owned by the public/government"" ""private=owned by private persons"". I think you're just misinterpreting private and publicly *traded* companies. As in, Amazon is a ""public"" company because everyone can buy shares of the company on the stock market, where shares of private companies aren't sold as freely.

So yes, of course antitrust laws still apply to companies not owned by the government. Doesn't matter if it's owned by one guy or half a million people."

You're only looking at the variables for one person, rather for the entire economy.

The person in your scenario has earned zero (not negative) and spent however much on improving the house (note that the purchase of the house isn't counted in GDP if the house had already been sold to someone before him). Whomever he spent the money on has received exactly that in earnings.

Aggregate spending and earnings are always exactly equal by definition. If you spend $100, somebody else receives $100."

If he had one, I'd expect him to have a CV available online of degrees earned and academic works written.  The university where he studied might also have listed him on a directory at some point.

[His personal site](http://elliswinningham.net/) gives no indication of such credentials either.

I do want to point out, though, that it is possible to understand economic theories reasonably well without a PhD.  It is also possible to have a PhD and misunderstand severely, or to have understood enough to pass exams and write an acceptable dissertation while you were a student, then convince yourself of nonsense afterward.

---

Glancing at some of this guy's writings, my first impression was that they seem to confuse more than they elucidate.  For instance, [the title of this post is true](http://elliswinningham.net/index.php/2019/02/05/the-budget-deficit-and-the-national-debt-not-the-same-thing/), but not in the least bit heterodox, and the text does the usual MMT thing of mixing sense with nonsense, occasionally justifying the sense, and mischaracterizing the mainstream view.  One example of the latter is the quote from Kalecki about confusing stocks and flows.  I don't know how Kalecki was taught, but I was taught the distinction between annual deficits and debts in Econ 101.

As for the nonsense, you've probably seen the stuff about money creation, taxation etc. in the subs you linked, and the independence of the Fed from Congress, etc.  They say it better than I could.

To Winningham's credit, though -- in that one post, he does state clearly the premise that the government creates money and, by deficit spending, enriches the public.  I'm skeptical that it works that way, but I've gotten the impression that this is the main claim of MMT, and he doesn't equivocate in saying it."

Second quarter 2008 Lehman became ""insolvent,"" meaning the value of their liabilities exceeded the value of the assets. It tried to raise money through stock issue, but by then the writing was on the wall and investors left. The stock value dropped by about 75% after they issued the stock. It continued to decline as other banks pulled out of talks with Lehman's management to acquire it.

On September 15, Lehman declared bankruptcy after the Bank of England refused Barclays's acquisition of Lehman. A couple of weeks later, Barclays did actually acquire most of Lehman's assets through bankruptcy court actions.

The above is a brief summary. Banking contracts/rules/regulations/laws are very complicated. One of the main factors were debt covenant restrictions. The assets were required to hold a value over a certain threshold. As the bond prices began to fall, banks were forced to sell more to meet the restrictions, which triggered lower prices as supply rushed to the market."

I believe the renovations would show up in investment, either as residential investment or as an increase in inventory for the house flipper.

Anything produced in an earlier year gets cancelled out by having inventory change be negative.  

An example:

Suppose that you produced 2 pretzels that sell for $1 each.  You only sell one of them.  The production method for GDP says that GDP is $2, the amount spent method says that the pretzel sold shows up as C=$1, and the pretzel not showed shows up as I=$1.  For the income method you have to remember that the pretzel you didn't sell is technically income for you.  You produced it and own it.  

Now in the next year you produce no pretzels and sell the remaining stale one for $1.  Then for the amount produced it's obviously zero.  For the amount spent it's still $0.  That's because whlie C=$1 because someone spent $1, I=$-1 because you drew down your inventory.  Finally for the amount earned you might be tempted to say that it's $1, but you came into this year with $1 in pretzel assets.  When you sell the pretzel assets for $1 your net worth hasn't increased.  You can say no income was generated because the change in wealth was 0 or you can say that your wealth went up by $1 and down by $1 in pretzels so the net income from that transaction was 0."

If we assume that it will become impossible to make profit of any kind by performing legally, a large black market would emerge and people that are able to might start to leave the country. If this black market would be crushed, poverty would increase further. Not to mention that currency will devaluate when production ceases, making it way harder to import and increase the spiralisation.

Isolation as a principle is rather unlikely imo. However devaluation of currency will make imports difficult.

The important thing to note is, that a situation, in which even marginal profit is impossible, is very unlikely. High minimum wages can have negative effects on the profits of certain businesses (like restaurants, cinemas, logistics or cleaning services), but they also allow those workers to spend more money on consumer goods, which most of them will do. When Germany first introduced a federal minimum wage a few years ago, there was resistance arguing that this will destroy its economy. However we know that this didn't happen.

What you want, instead, is something more like this: 

Suppose everyone starts out with some initial endowment of goods.  Person 1 asks everyone else what they'd like to swap (e.g. one orange for two grapes, or what have you).  The other players are free to accept or reject the offer to swap.  In theory, Person 1 would only offer a swap if he's willing to do it, i.e. he values what he's getting at least as much as what he's giving; and similarly, other people would accept the swap only if they value what they're getting as much as what they're giving.  Thus, if person 1 initially has lots of oranges and very few grapes, and would give up an orange (or more than one, if needed) for two grapes; while person 2 has few oranges and many grapes, and would give up two grapes (or more, if needed) for one orange -- then they can swap, and both end up liking their new bundle of goods better than the old one.

After Person 1 has offered everyone a chance to swap, Person 2 can go, and so on.  Keep going until everyone has had a chance to swap with everyone else, and there is nothing left that they still want to swap and haven't got around to.

Across the post-WWII Soviet network of allies, communist states generally controlled all access to raw material, all  production, and all ownership of capital goods (machines that produce products).  But, they generally (or eventually) allowed enough economic freedom that individuals could own small service businesses (like a laundromat) or operate as a merchant (as long as they obeyed the rules on price controls and sourced from the state agencies).

It's also important to keep in mind that ""communism"" is a variable term.  Marx and Engles never prescribed what a communist state would specifically look like.  Communism's history is very diverse just like Capitalism's.

Without diving into specifics, the general trend looked something like this:

* Revolution:  workers seize the means of production.
* Communism sets in: assets are distributed by force and become communal
* Market Reform: Central Planning fails for one reason or another, and the state is forced to relax the rules on price controls or other economic policies, the de-collectivization of agriculture often took place.
* Political Reform: Citizens gain some economic rights and start small businesses.

They may disagree on theory as well, but the differences between supporting capitalism vs socialism are differences of which policies you like and which members of the economy you prefer to support.

What capitalism and socialism are, instead, are vaguely defined political terms describing different ways of organizing the economy, or perhaps different ideologies.  Capitalism might be defined as an economic system where the ""means of production"" are privately owned by some people (call them capitalists), who hire other people to work for them and try to make a profit.  Or it could be a political ideology -- say, the ideology of liking the system of capitalism, or (which is not the same thing), the ideology of siding with the capitalists over the workers.  Socialism is probably even harder to define-- does socialism mean a planned economy like the USSR?  Was the USSR ""state capitalist"" instead?  Is Denmark socialist?

I think part of the problem is that the words are highly political.  For instance, among Americans born before, say, the breakup of the USSR, socialism is a bad word, so you can dismiss any positions to the left of your own by defining them as ""socialism,"" without worrying about what, if anything, the word really means, whether it fits, or whether your opponent's proposals are bad.  Recently, with a more left-leaning generation of young people coming of voting age, candidates for president can proudly call themselves socialist with, again, no clear sense of what the word means except siding against the rich.  For that matter, I don't know what ""real socialism"" is either, because no one seems to agree on what it means.  (Some people claim that it's self-evident what ""real socialism"" is, and that there's only confusion because their opponents want to confuse you--but I've found it hard to get them to state a clear and concise definition, and people who think it's obvious don't always agree on what the ""obviously right"" definition is.)

I believe the renovations would show up in investment, either as residential investment or as an increase in inventory for the house flipper.

Anything produced in an earlier year gets cancelled out by having inventory change be negative.  

An example:

Suppose that you produced 2 pretzels that sell for $1 each.  You only sell one of them.  The production method for GDP says that GDP is $2, the amount spent method says that the pretzel sold shows up as C=$1, and the pretzel not showed shows up as I=$1.  For the income method you have to remember that the pretzel you didn't sell is technically income for you.  You produced it and own it.  

Now in the next year you produce no pretzels and sell the remaining stale one for $1.  Then for the amount produced it's obviously zero.  For the amount spent it's still $0.  That's because whlie C=$1 because someone spent $1, I=$-1 because you drew down your inventory.  Finally for the amount earned you might be tempted to say that it's $1, but you came into this year with $1 in pretzel assets.  When you sell the pretzel assets for $1 your net worth hasn't increased.  You can say no income was generated because the change in wealth was 0 or you can say that your wealth went up by $1 and down by $1 in pretzels so the net income from that transaction was 0."

>Jayadev and Mason argue that MMT, as they understand it, swaps the roles of fiscal and monetary policy. Under standard macroeconomics, ensuring that the economy is at full employment and that prices are stable are the responsibilities of the monetary policy — the Federal Reserve — which can achieve both goals by manipulating interest rates. If the Fed hits a 0 percent interest rate, then fiscal authorities (Congress and the president) can come in to boost aggregate demand and get the economy moving again, as the 2008 and 2009 stimulus measures attempted. But normally, it’s all the Fed’s job.  
>  
>In MMT, the fiscal authority is in charge of both. Most MMTers are of the view that the [**interest rate**](http://www.cfeps.org/pubs/wp-pdf/WP37-MoslerForstater.pdf) [**set by the Federal Reserve**](http://bilbo.economicoutlook.net/blog/?p=4656) should always be 0 percent — in part because they think the use of government-issued bonds that bear interest is a mostly pointless practice. “Our preferred position is a natural rate of zero and no bond sales. Then allow fiscal policy to make all the adjustments,” [**Mitchell wrote in a 2009 blog post**](http://bilbo.economicoutlook.net/blog/?p=4656). “It is much cleaner that way.” \[\[source\]\]( [https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/4/16/18251646/modern-monetary-theory-new-moment-explained](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/4/16/18251646/modern-monetary-theory-new-moment-explained) )

So under MMT, fiscal policy plays a more active role in countering inflation. Which if you don't subscribe to the monetarist paradigm that inflation is merely a result of the money supply, isn't a crazy idea.

> the general view on those ""idle capacities"" is that they either aren't many, or any. In other words, the US is pretty close to potential GDP 

This is not a consensus view. There are tons of unemployed and underemployed workers. That's why MMT advocates a jobs guarantee to put these idle resources to use and achieve full employment. Furthermore, there are tons of factories that have shut down and/or moved overseas, leaving behind bleak communities riddled with opioid addicts. We're seeing large vacancies in commercial real estate and malls shutting down. MMTers would strongly disagree with the notion that we are already near full capacity, and MMT or not I don't see how anyone can think that here in the U.S. I mean have you seen the number of homeless people in NYC/SF/LA or been to a ghetto?

Also, GDP is a terrible metric to measure an economy's well-being. Producing more for the sake of producing more is meaningless.

The important thing to note is, that a situation, in which even marginal profit is impossible, is very unlikely. High minimum wages can have negative effects on the profits of certain businesses (like restaurants, cinemas, logistics or cleaning services), but they also allow those workers to spend more money on consumer goods, which most of them will do.

Economies in general seem too volatile and unpredictable (to  me) to just print money and assume that future growth will make up for it.  I do not know much about economics.  So, am I missing something here?

Let's start off with this one, since I think it's worth making clear first.

Inflation in a modern economy like the US is generally not particularly volatile. That's because one of the highest priorities of the federal reserve is to keep inflation steady at a slightly positive level (in the US about 2%). And the fed generally does a reasonably good job.

Also, the general assumption that a country that controls its own currency ""cannot go bankrupt"" is true, and these countries generally can (and should) take on a good bit of debt to finance themselves. That's not exactly a controversial part of MMT and perfectly in line with mainstream economics.

Just as a sidenote, it's not at all uncommon for the cost of government debt to be negative. Or in other words, that it's more expensive not to take on debt.

One thing to note with MMT in general is that it's a bit of a mix between old school Keynesianism (that's been outdated for decades) and their own ideas, so it's not always straight up *wrong*, but more of a case that we know better nowadays.

>From the article: ""...Kelton argues that runaway prices are only a  danger when demand  outstrips the real resources in an economy — the  people, machines and  raw materials. If there's idle capacity, MMT  maintains that additional  government spending does not trigger  inflation.""

That probably sums it up relatively well. Yes, you can do this, the question is how, and how much. MMT, or at least many proponents, tell it a bit like this; the central bank should print more money to fill the need for money because that's better, since you have this ""idle capacity"".

The issue here is two fold. The role of the federal reserve isn't so much to ""finance stuff"" as it is to keep the economy stable. This *can* mean ""boosting the economy"", but only as the means, not as the end. (Btw., generally the role of the fed is to keep prices stable and allow full employment). The fed is independent from the government and its purpose is not to finance the government.

Next, money is neutral in the long run. That means it doesn't matter ""how much"" money there is. It does not have an influence on real variables like employment, real GDP, etc., only on nominal ones like prices and exchange rates. Printing money does not move around real resources in the long run.

Of course, stuff still happens in the short run. But even then, the general view on those ""idle capacities"" is that they either aren't many, or any. In other words, the US is pretty close to potential GDP. And besides that, spending more to any substantial degree still has to be countered by something. Higher taxes for example. Else you're just taking on more and more debt, fucking up exchange rates, leading to runaway inflation, crowding out private investors, etc.

MMT has counterarguments to a lot of those, but they are either completely rejected by mainstream economics, or lack any sort of strong empirical support. The vast majority of MMT is theory and theory only, with little backup from actual data and studies."

Walmart would never leave the US. Why would they? All salaries and bills and costs settled, they make billions of dollars in profit in the US market. Whatever the tax rate, they'd still make some profit. They can't make money off US customers with stores in France. They have to be in the US.

This sort of thing is more applicable (or easier understood in the case of) individuals with wealth. If you're a 50-year old investor with a net worth of, say, 100 million USD, you can choose how you deploy it, and you can choose to not deploy it in the US.

Now this part varies from country to country, but whether it makes sense to move money depends on the existence of Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements between two countries. If Singapore taxes capital gains at 5%, and the US at 25% (I'm just making numbers up), and there exists a DTAA, a multimillionaire could just move all his money. Now with his capital in Singapore, he's also constrained to invest in assets available there, so it's not a straightforward arithmetic.

The Walmart would remain, it's just that more people would/might/are likely to decide to sell their stake in it and remit their capital abroad."

This question is not about Trump's politics or whether or not he can live up to that claim. This question is about why the USA (and other rich countries, such as Australia) have collapsing manufacturing sectors. Who, or what is to blame for this?

* Also, I personally find it quite odd that the USA in particular has a collapsing manufacturing sector, because its [low minimum wage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_minimum_wages_by_country) and large pool of cheap migrant labour (or even prison labour) sound like they would be extremely advantageous for the manufacturing sector. I frequently encounter the claim that ""*the USA is too rich to stay competitive as a manufacturing powerhouse*"". 
* Meanwhile, Germany and Japan somehow manage to have strong manufacturing sectors, despite also being rich countries **and** being what many Americans call ""welfare states"". Does this mean that rich welfare states are actually a good place to set up manufacturing industries?"

As for why we should have strictly positive mild trend inflation the story is usually that wages are downwardly rigid and so in bad times it lets employers cut real wages but just leaving wages unchanged.  The other reason is the zero lower bound on interest rates.  Higher inflation rates give the Fed more room to wiggle on the nominal interest rate, and since R* seems stuck at a low value for now that appears important.

Deflation is worse though.  It causes consumers to put spending off because they’ll expect prices to fall even more and because their nominal incomes are falling.  It can be bad for borrowers if it’s unexpected."

College isn't like high school in terms of the curriculum. You'll find that you have a lot more leeway in studying things that you are interested in, but you should talk to your advisor on campus before you make your schedules.

It's worth your while to consider minors that will help you differentiate—Econ majors are a dime a dozen, so even if you're going to get a 4.00 on top of your internships and extracurriculars, you're going to want some specialty. I don't know what your school offers, but my school offers minors in Business and Computer Science that fit into my schedule nicely, so I'm doing both of those in addition to my BA, because the overall number of extra classes is minimal when you consider how much better off I am with them as opposed to without them.

Also—are you pursuing a BA or a BS? Some schools don't even offer the BS, because it's more technical and most of the classes they would have you take for the BS are going to leave you a few credits short of a minor, but they're going to take up so much time that most people don't pursue a BS with a minor.

I'd phrase it more like free trade allows countries to specialize and maximize efficiency. That free trade, while generally thought of in terms of goods, would also include people.

Now theoretically even it can get quite complicated, but to make it simple it all comes down to cost benefit analysis. There is generally a cost, either explicit or hidden, with moving to a new country for work (even temporary) so the wages for work need necessarily outweigh those costs for the immigrants to actually migrate. Factors that play into this are things like job opportunities and wages in the home country, job opportunities in the target country, the immigrants education, and their current wages. When you get more hidden costs you have things like language barrier and how tied the person feels to their current home. 

I wouldn't say that immigration is bad though once the immigrant decides to migrate. I just would be careful about the idea that economists want mass immigration. I think for economists looking to maximize economic efficiency, you are aiming to minimize costs and quotas so that there is as much free movement as possible of people so that the ""free market"" can work things out. 

>But in a capitalist system like here in the United States, the number of jobs are a finite source


This bit though, is the part that I think you need to really reconsider. I'm not really too concerned with the oughts and shoulds since that is always going to be normative and while you may get economists who agree with the position I laid out, you can also get economists who counter it. 

However, in either scenario, both economists would point to this and say flatly that you are misinformed. There is nothing about a capitalist system or any economic system (except maybe very strict state controlled) that makes work/jobs finite. 

This is what is referred to as the lump of labor fallacy and it has been talked about in political rhetoric for near a century with 0 empirical evidence to back it up. There is no such thing as finite amount of work. That is actually a founding principal of modern economic theory and why if you talk with an economist, while you might find some worried about the automated revolution. You will find few who will say that it will lead to everyone having nothing to do. That is lump of labor. Even if robots took over every job tomorrow, there would still be other jobs to do. Because there is always work able to be done. So, you can argue over policy in immigration all you want, you will find economists on both sides (maybe more on one side than another), but you will find none that use this finite work argument.

Because it seems pretty nonsensical.  For instance, in the section ""critique of perfect competition,"" it claims that mainstream economics depends on models of perfect competition, and that imperfect competition is heterodox -- not at all an accurate characterization of mainstream thought.  It also claims that ""the theory of imperfect competition is intrinsically dependent on the theory of perfect competition,"" and claims that he has figured out ""real"" competition that is neither perfect nor imperfect, which all seems strange to me as well.  ""Imperfect competition"" is just a catch-all term for any competition (i.e. not pure monopoly) except the special case of ""perfect competition.""

But maybe that Wiki page does not represent him fairly?  Let's look at http://www.anwarshaikhecon.org/.  That page has his name in the URL, links to his twitter and essays, sells his book, etc.  It's probably the real deal.

""As one of the world’s leading heterodox economists, Anwar Shaikh has taught at The New School for Social Research for more than 30 years, authored three books and six-dozen articles.""  I commend his seemly modesty.

Now, those [essays](http://www.anwarshaikhecon.org/index.php/all-publications).  A scholar should be judged by his scholarly writings.  Let's take a look at [the first link](http://www.anwarshaikhecon.org/sortable/images/docs/publications/political_economy/2019/Capitalism_Book%20_Logical_Structure_2019.pdf)  On the first page, see the section ""Real competition not perfect or imperfect competition.""  

""... real competition, in which price-setting firms seek to undercut
their competitors by offering lower prices. The survival advantage in price-cutting goes to firms with
lower costs: hence the relentless drive to cut costs, to pursue lower wages, and to develop new lower cost technologies.""

That undercutting bit sounds [awfully familiar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_competition)--I was taught about this in undergrad.  Admittedly he also mentions bargaining between capital and labor, which could bring in some of the game theory literature; and geographic mobility of capital, which might use work from trade or urban economics.  

However, I don't see him actually working out the results of this model in this document, or in other promising-looking essays like [""HETERODOX ECONOMICS AS A TRUE ALTERNATIVE:
GOING BEYOND THE OPPOSITION BETWEEN
""PERFECT"" AND ""IMPERFECT"" BEHAVIORS""](http://www.anwarshaikhecon.org/sortable/images/docs/publications/political_economy/2013/Heterodox%20Economics%20as%20a%20True%20Alternative,%202013,%20NSER,%20vol6.pdf) or the ambitiously titled [""Rethinking Microeconomics: A Proposed
Reconstruction ""](http://www.anwarshaikhecon.org/sortable/images/docs/publications/macroeconomic_theory/2012/NSSR_WP_062012.pdf).

Because it seems pretty nonsensical.  For instance, in the section ""critique of perfect competition,"" it claims that mainstream economics depends on models of perfect competition, and that imperfect competition is heterodox -- not at all an accurate characterization of mainstream thought.  It also claims that ""the theory of imperfect competition is intrinsically dependent on the theory of perfect competition,"" and claims that he has figured out ""real"" competition that is neither perfect nor imperfect, which all seems strange to me as well.  ""Imperfect competition"" is just a catch-all term for any competition (i.e. not pure monopoly) except the special case of ""perfect competition.""

But maybe that Wiki page does not represent him fairly?  Let's look at http://www.anwarshaikhecon.org/.  That page has his name in the URL, links to his twitter and essays, sells his book, etc.  It's probably the real deal.

""As one of the world’s leading heterodox economists, Anwar Shaikh has taught at The New School for Social Research for more than 30 years, authored three books and six-dozen articles.""  I commend his seemly modesty.

Now, those [essays](http://www.anwarshaikhecon.org/index.php/all-publications).  A scholar should be judged by his scholarly writings.  Let's take a look at [the first link](http://www.anwarshaikhecon.org/sortable/images/docs/publications/political_economy/2019/Capitalism_Book%20_Logical_Structure_2019.pdf)  On the first page, see the section ""Real competition not perfect or imperfect competition.""  

""... real competition, in which price-setting firms seek to undercut
their competitors by offering lower prices. The survival advantage in price-cutting goes to firms with
lower costs: hence the relentless drive to cut costs, to pursue lower wages, and to develop new lower cost technologies.""

That undercutting bit sounds [awfully familiar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_competition)--I was taught about this in undergrad.  Admittedly he also mentions bargaining between capital and labor, which could bring in some of the game theory literature; and geographic mobility of capital, which might use work from trade or urban economics.  

However, I don't see him actually working out the results of this model in this document, or in other promising-looking essays like [""HETERODOX ECONOMICS AS A TRUE ALTERNATIVE:

A bit of background about me, I'm essentially somewhat of a failed economist. I've found myself at the age of 27, I studied economics at an undergraduate level in the UK and am yet to find myself a job in the field. I absolutely love the pursuit but it doesn't seem to be working out for me. Even so, I attained a decent grade of 2:1 at a reasonably prolific university here in the UK (Aberystwyth - Prince Charles went there I'll have you know!).

It's becoming increasingly clear to me that views of the world are very subjective in accordance to where you are and this is the main reason that I would like to talk to someone born and raised elsewhere about current events etc. - Furthermore, you yanks tend to be rather switched on, and it doesn't hurt that you chaps speak English as a native language.

&#x200B;

I am of the opinion that economics is more philosophical rather than scientific - I understand that statistics are the lynch-pin in the subject - (weirdly enough statistics and maths are my strongest area looking back at my grades.) However, I think that being able to accurately model anything in micro-economics, really is a fantasy - as we all know the rational consumer does not exist.. Inferences can be gained and discredited to a point, but, when it comes down to it, It feels like economics is an educated guessing game.

Don't get me wrong, I think economics is **the best** class / study that anyone can take (if I had my way everyone would study economics for at least one year)

I'd absolutely love to have a discussion or two with one of our friends over the pond, - (the reason I am posting in [r/AskEconomics](https://www.reddit.com/r/economics/) is I would like to find a like minded individual, and failing that someone who uses economics as their reasoning, rather than politics)

I would definitely start out down the old pen pal route, finding out a little about you and discussing the different worlds that we deal in. This could be followed by what we believe the future holds for us independently and for the world.

As I say in the title, I would absolutely love an economics pen pal."

First part. This is not really an /r/AskEconomics kind of question, but anyway:

Yes, they were state capitalist, or [state socialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_socialism), which is basically the same thing.


> If so, why do we call it communist?

Because they called themselves that. The called themselves that because in Marxism-Leninism, state socialism / state capitalism is the practical implementation of the [dictatorship of the proletariat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictatorship_of_the_proletariat) proposed by Marx and Engels, see Lenin's [The State and Revolution, 1917](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_State_and_Revolution).

if you create or transfer wealth those who have the new wealth will spend at least some it. the additional spending will be on goods that demographic purchases or needs to purchase (since they didn't have the money otherwise). the price of those goods will go up as a result of the demand curve shifting.  it would take specific dynamics is supply to overcome making generalized statements of its impact on inflation ridiculous.  

&#x200B;

If wealth was transferred (from the wealthy) the price of goods commonly bought by those who are negatively impacted by the wealth transfer will go down as they buy fewer of those goods...which are probably not the same goods that the positively impacted people would have purchased (necessity vs. luxury).  Another odd thing, it could be that those who lost wealth or a portion of them might have to now purchase more goods that the originally poorer demographic is/was buying as they can't afford the luxury items anymore.

IMO it can be more rigorous than physics because of the pure scale you need to adjust and account for equations. My girlfriend is a Civil Engineer, and I find her work and application of her knowledge is more like piecing together a puzzle where you can more clearly isolate different factors to work towards a solution; whereas economics you need to build a path to either prove or disprove your hypothesis. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying one is easier or harder (and she is much smarter than I am), but I’m just speaking on that part of your question. 

But I will say that Economics is a lot more theoretical. I almost wish I had focused more on Behavioral Economics in undergrad, because that field is blowing up and bleeds into all other aspects of Economics. Putting data into Excel or R and getting results is easy enough, but the math side is only one aspect of actually using Economics as a social science. Physics follow regular laws and those will not change; Economics follows theories. More often than not you are working with hypothetical numbers and you have to work backwards to see why reality paints a different picture than what the “logical” choice is. 

Add in the fact that there is so much more impacting an Economics experiment in the world economy than a physics experiment, you can drive yourself insane trying to isolate and account for everything to reach the truth.

438,BainCapitalist,approvecomment,2019-07-18 20:14:44,t1_eu5alqy,"A bit of a disclaimer, this is an incredibly large question, getting to core and unresolved questions of how to organize our economy, so my answer will be by no means comprehensive or definitive.

Premise 1: Wealthier people tend to invest their capital which means that they live of the income of their capital and not of the capital per se. The investments will pump money to the overall economy and when well managed, it will lead to new jobs and it will create a more dynamic economy. Is that correct?

The first thing we should do is define capital. Capital has a different meaning in finance/accounting versus in economics. The economics definition of capital is one of the factors of production. In that definition capital is the stuff you need to produce, like machines, factories, trucks, hammers, etc. I am guessing you are using the more financial definition of effectively wealth/assets. In econ investment is effectively the desicion to produce more capital. Investment is the idea that you are using capital to make more capital. Use your machines to build a factory and not a playground.

There is really no proof to prove or disprove your premise. Wealthier people do tend have a higher marginal propensity to save than poorer people. But cultural factors also affect people's propensity to save, for example USA has a much lower average rate of saving than Japan. Does investing/saving lead to more jobs and dynamic economy? That is situational. In growth theory there is something called the golden rule of savings. Its the idea of how much do you want to save. One of my professors once describe econ as the study of how much to party now and how much to party later. Every dollar you save is one less dollar you are using to party and one more dollar to party later. Because remember, investment is a long term premise. But the golden rule says you only want to save so much, if you save too much you will actually be undermining the robustness of the economy.

&#x200B;

So yes, saving is important for the economy, and wealthier people tend to save more. But too much savings is bad, and it is not theoretically definitive if you need wealthy people to save enough to fulfill the golden rule.

&#x200B;

Premise 2:

Even if wealthier people saved all their money in the bank, it would make credit more abundant and with lower interest rates, which will allow the middle class to buy and invest more easily and the low interest rate would make those credit “cost” less to the general consumer. Is that correct?

&#x200B;

More savings will lead to a lower cost of credit.

&#x200B;

Premise 3:

 If both statement are correct, then despite of the rising of inequality, our modern economy will continue working and creating new jobs and new ideas. How is the inequality a threat to the our modern economy? The upper last is always interest in making more money of their investments, so they benefit from investing in the global economy and its in their own interest that we have an economy working properly and with richer and richer consumers willing to consume their products 

&#x200B;

The threat of inequality has less to do with concerns of savings/availability of credit. In fact, there is a global savings glut right now. The concern that Krugman and Piketty are getting at is actually I would say very unrelated to your premises.  They are more concerned about the highly unequal nature of the growth. Piketty's core argument is that r > g. What this means is the return on your capital is higher than the growth rate. As a result, there will be perpetual inequality between the capital owning class and the non capital owning class. Besides the concern of a dynamic growing economy, they are concerned about the implications of inequality. Who cares that we have smart phones if we still live in a society where kids go to bed hungry? That is the concern of inequality. 

&#x200B;

However, as a threat to the robustness of the economy, some people argue that inequality actually causes capital to be less effective. If inequality leads to some segments of the population being left out from effective education (failing public schools versus private boarding skills), our rising inequality is creating a less dynamic economy. Another argument is that what made the USA so successful during the 1800s and 1900s was how unconsolidated capital was. Anyone could move west and get land, after WW2, the economy was growing so fast that g > r. These conditions created a dynamic economy that facilitated innovation. 

&#x200B;

In sum, the concerns of inequality are not that linked to the amount of investment in the economy, but how inequality actually affects society and the economy."

A concept that is necessary to explain the phenomenon is called a concept called Fisherian Deflation/Fisherian debt deflation/debt deflation. This is a popular mechanism that people use to explain sudden stops in emerging markets and people have applied this concept to the crisis in 2008 as well. Now I don't think this is the only mechanism at play here, but this is a popular mechanism that people use to explain such phenomenons. 

What this basically says is, when we have a boom, that means output is high and demand is high. When output is high and demand is high, what this does is it drives up prices of assets such as stocks, housings, or any types of asset prices that you can collateralize. Now, a rise in asset prices increases your net worth. What does this do? This allows you to borrow more now. So this is one popular explanation as to how people can leverage during good times as well. 

What is important or different here? Typically, we assume that rational agents who makes consumption savings decisions typically borrow in bad times to smooth their consumption and save in good times to save for a rainy day. However, financial frictions in the market do not allow this always. A lot of times, when you go to the bank and borrow, you must collateralize your borrowing with houses, cars etc. Thus, if the value of your house rises, the limit as to what you can borrow also rises. This rise and fall in asset prices have an effect on your net worth which could impact your consumption and savings decision.

458,AutoModerator,removecomment,2019-07-18 19:13:16,t1_eu5gp6w,"So I think I can answer how it can be growing during a boom. A concept that is necessary to explain the phenomenon is called a concept called Fisherian Deflation/Fisherian debt deflation/debt deflation. This is a popular mechanism that people use to explain sudden stops in emerging markets and people have applied this concept to the crisis in 2008 as well. Now I don't think this is the only mechanism at play here, but this is a popular mechanism that people use to explain such phenomenons. 

What this basically says is, when we have a boom, that means output is high and demand is high. When output is high and demand is high, what this does is it drives up prices of assets such as stocks, housings, or any types of asset prices that you can collateralize. Now, a rise in asset prices increases your net worth. What does this do? This allows you to borrow more now. So this is one popular explanation as to how people can leverage during good times as well. 

What is important or different here? Typically, we assume that rational agents who makes consumption savings decisions typically borrow in bad times to smooth their consumption and save in good times to save for a rainy day. However, financial frictions in the market do not allow this always. A lot of times, when you go to the bank and borrow, you must collateralize your borrowing with houses, cars etc. Thus, if the value of your house rises, the limit as to what you can borrow also rises. This rise and fall in asset prices have an effect on your net worth which could impact your consumption and savings decision.

463,AutoModerator,removecomment,2019-07-18 18:10:31,t1_eu5alqy,"A bit of a disclaimer, this is an incredibly large question, getting to core and unresolved questions of how to organize our economy, so my answer will be by no means comprehensive or definitive.

Premise 1: Wealthier people tend to invest their capital which means that they live of the income of their capital and not of the capital per se. The investments will pump money to the overall economy and when well managed, it will lead to new jobs and it will create a more dynamic economy. Is that correct?

The first thing we should do is define capital. Capital has a different meaning in finance/accounting versus in economics. The economics definition of capital is one of the factors of production. In that definition capital is the stuff you need to produce, like machines, factories, trucks, hammers, etc. I am guessing you are using the more financial definition of effectively wealth/assets. In econ investment is effectively the desicion to produce more capital. Investment is the idea that you are using capital to make more capital. Use your machines to build a factory and not a playground.

There is really no proof to prove or disprove your premise. Wealthier people do tend have a higher marginal propensity to save than poorer people. But cultural factors also affect people's propensity to save, for example USA has a much lower average rate of saving than Japan. Does investing/saving lead to more jobs and dynamic economy? That is situational. In growth theory there is something called the golden rule of savings. Its the idea of how much do you want to save. One of my professors once describe econ as the study of how much to party now and how much to party later. Every dollar you save is one less dollar you are using to party and one more dollar to party later. Because remember, investment is a long term premise. But the golden rule says you only want to save so much, if you save too much you will actually be undermining the robustness of the economy.

&#x200B;

So yes, saving is important for the economy, and wealthier people tend to save more. But too much savings is bad, and it is not theoretically definitive if you need wealthy people to save enough to fulfill the golden rule.

&#x200B;

Premise 2:

Even if wealthier people saved all their money in the bank, it would make credit more abundant and with lower interest rates, which will allow the middle class to buy and invest more easily and the low interest rate would make those credit “cost” less to the general consumer. Is that correct?

&#x200B;

More savings will lead to a lower cost of credit.

&#x200B;

Premise 3:

 If both statement are correct, then despite of the rising of inequality, our modern economy will continue working and creating new jobs and new ideas. How is the inequality a threat to the our modern economy? The upper last is always interest in making more money of their investments, so they benefit from investing in the global economy and its in their own interest that we have an economy working properly and with richer and richer consumers willing to consume their products 

&#x200B;

The threat of inequality has less to do with concerns of savings/availability of credit. In fact, there is a global savings glut right now. The concern that Krugman and Piketty are getting at is actually I would say very unrelated to your premises.  They are more concerned about the highly unequal nature of the growth. Piketty's core argument is that r > g. What this means is the return on your capital is higher than the growth rate. As a result, there will be perpetual inequality between the capital owning class and the non capital owning class. Besides the concern of a dynamic growing economy, they are concerned about the implications of inequality. Who cares that we have smart phones if we still live in a society where kids go to bed hungry? That is the concern of inequality. 

&#x200B;

However, as a threat to the robustness of the economy, some people argue that inequality actually causes capital to be less effective. If inequality leads to some segments of the population being left out from effective education (failing public schools versus private boarding skills), our rising inequality is creating a less dynamic economy. Another argument is that what made the USA so successful during the 1800s and 1900s was how unconsolidated capital was. Anyone could move west and get land, after WW2, the economy was growing so fast that g > r. These conditions created a dynamic economy that facilitated innovation. 

&#x200B;

In sum, the concerns of inequality are not that linked to the amount of investment in the economy, but how inequality actually affects society and the economy."

IMO it can be more rigorous than physics because of the pure scale you need to adjust and account for equations. My girlfriend is a Civil Engineer, and I find her work and application of her knowledge is more like piecing together a puzzle where you can more clearly isolate different factors to work towards a solution; whereas economics you need to build a path to either prove or disprove your hypothesis. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying one is easier or harder (and she is much smarter than I am), but I’m just speaking on that part of your question. 

But I will say that Economics is a lot more theoretical. I almost wish I had focused more on Behavioral Economics in undergrad, because that field is blowing up and bleeds into all other aspects of Economics. Putting data into Excel or R and getting results is easy enough, but the math side is only one aspect of actually using Economics as a social science. Physics follow regular laws and those will not change; Economics follows theories. More often than not you are working with hypothetical numbers and you have to work backwards to see why reality paints a different picture than what the “logical” choice is. 

Add in the fact that there is so much more impacting an Economics experiment in the world economy than a physics experiment, you can drive yourself insane trying to isolate and account for everything to reach the truth. New observations and ideas get brought up every day, and even the most solid academic studies get revised and added onto all the time."

If wealth was transferred (from the wealthy) the price of goods commonly bought by those who are negatively impacted by the wealth transfer will go down as they buy fewer of those goods...which are probably not the same goods that the positively impacted people would have purchased (necessity vs. luxury).  Another odd thing, it could be that those who lost wealth or a portion of them might have to now purchase more goods that the originally poorer demographic is/was buying as they can't afford the luxury items anymore.

The object of study are not inanimate objects interacting or colliding, but rather *self-reflexive* subjects. Humans take note of the way people think about them. Forecasts, theories, economics itself becomes a part of the process it's trying to explain. Plus, we have innate *agency*, usually defined as the ""power to do it differently"". 

This means that you always have to acknowledge the *social and historical* embeddedness of certain relations. Until the 70's, people didn't think high inflation and high unemployment could happen at the same time. Nowadays, we're reaching levels of private and public debt many previously thought as being unsustainable. Women's labor force participation grew massively during the 20th century and that's going to keep changing a lot of other variables as well. There are many examples of previously stable relationships breaking down or changing into something different. 

You can build models based on certain assumptions in the most rigorous ways. Economics actually has some overlap with physics, especially in network analysis and complexity science. However, the variables and their relationship are always changing. You're going to have to look at structural factors to be able to explain what's actually going on and even then, there isn't really any ""truth"" or ""causal law"" in social life in Platonic limbo just waiting to be found, just explanations with varying degrees of explanatory power.

These are challenges common to each social science. But in my opinion, that's what makes it so interesting. Changing social circumstances always demand you to keep up to date, to challenge your assumptions, to choose your models thoughtfully and discard dogmas or ideologies that attempt to tell you that ""everything works like this"". It's fun and you learn a lot about how humans in big numbers (aka communities and societies) do about their life. I can recommend it."

Perfect competition would mean vast, vast reduction in economic inequality. Most economic inequality is the direct result of economic rents. Sure, there is and will always be discrepancies in skill and work ethic and desire, but that doesn't lead to the massive inequality we are today. 

Perfect competition would mean no one would ever pay more for a product than the value of it's inputs and the opportunity cost of the capital and labor involved. Thus, there would be no excessive shareholder profits leftover and wealth would not accumulate in anything resembling current times.

The idea of profit that OP pointed out has become so ingrained in us that it made you ask this question in the first place, because you couldn't imagine a world without it, even though it is consistent with economic theory and also morally superior, assuming you care about income inequality.

This is not dystopian, this is utopian. Every consumer need is met, and there are no shareholders because competition has forced anyone who does not contribute value to the end product out of the system. Shareholders, aside from some rare exceptions, do not contribute value to the customer. They extract it. They disappear min your scenario.

Interest rates would go way down, because capital is allocated correctly according to opportunity cost. This would hurt savers but also dramatically reduce income inequality. 

Why would interest rates go down? Because most interest rates are set in situations of asymmetrical power. The buyer needs the cash more than the seller needs to lend it, or the buyer has inferior information. This inflates interest. But in a perfectly competitive system, interest rates would be equal to or near the inflation rate. 

Slack and inefficiency is not the same thing as good competition in the market. They can both exist at the same time. For example, manufacturing in the 1940s looks super inefficient from today's standards, but there was also far less market consolidation, so there was a lot more competitive markets."

The object of study are not inanimate objects interacting or colliding, but rather *self-reflexive* subjects. Humans take note of the way people think about them. Forecasts, theories, economics itself becomes a part of the process it's trying to explain. Plus, we have innate *agency*, usually defined as the ""power to do it differently"". 

This means that you always have to acknowledge the *social and historical* embeddedness of certain relations. Until the 70's, people didn't think high inflation and high unemployment could happen at the same time. Nowadays, we're reaching levels of private and public debt many previously thought as being unsustainable. Women's labor force participation grew massively during the 20th century and that's going to keep changing a lot of other variables as well. There are many examples of previously stable relationships breaking down or changing into something different. 

You can build models based on certain assumptions in the most rigorous ways. Economics actually has some overlap with physics, especially in network analysis and complexity science. However, the variables and their relationship are always changing. You're going to have to look at structural factors to be able to explain what's actually going on and even then, there isn't really any ""truth"" or ""causal law"" in social life in Platonic limbo just waiting to be found, just explanations with varying degrees of explanatory power.

These are challenges common to each social science. But in my opinion, that's what makes it so interesting. Changing social circumstances always demand you to keep up to date, to challenge your assumptions, to choose your models thoughtfully and discard dogmas or ideologies that attempt to tell you that ""everything works like this"". It's fun and you learn a lot about how humans in big numbers (aka communities and societies) do about their life. I can recommend it."

We use the concept to describe a consumer's preferences, but it doesn't mean much to say that one consumer has a utility level of 5, or that you have more utility than I do, or that a certain monster gets more utility from consuming everything than anyone else would get.

We normally think of preference relations as being ordinal [edit-- this means the order of preferences is meaningful, but the ""level"" of preference is not].  If bundle A and bundle B are both available, the consumer can afford both, and the consumer chooses A, then we know that the consumer prefers A (in the sense of weak preference -- they may be indifferent, but they cannot strictly prefer B, otherwise they would have taken that instead.)  What we don't know is ""by how much"" the consumer prefers bundle A over bundle B.

We can use a utility function to represent these preference relations: U() maps bundles to real numbers such that U(A) >= U(B) if and only if the consumer weakly prefers bundle A to bundle B, etc.  Any preferences that are ""complete"" (any two bundles in the domain can be compared), transitive, and (for technical reasons) continuous are equivalent to a utility function.  (There's a nice proof in [Jehle and Reny](https://edisciplinas.usp.br/pluginfile.php/1005494/mod_resource/content/1/jehle.pdf) -- see Theorem 1.1 on page 14.)  

The thing is, this utility function is only defined up to a [monotonic transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotonic_function#Monotonic_transformation).  In other words, any other function that preserves the order of preference and the same indifference curves, also represents the same preferences.

For example, if your preferences are represented by U(X,Y) = X^a * Y^b, then they are also represented by U(X,Y) = a * ln(X) + b * ln(Y), which is the logarithm (a monotone function) of the first utility function.  The number of ""utils"" you get from any bundle has changed, but the ranking of which bundles you prefer has not.

-- -- -- 

Of course, transforming the utility function like that is going to change the marginal utilities (i.e. partial derivatives) you get from it, even though it still represents the same preferences.

However, what does not change is the *ratio* of these marginal utilities.  See, for instance, [Wikipedia on marginal rates of substitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_rate_of_substitution), or [chapter 7 of Varian](http://www.apmath.spbu.ru/ru/staff/kuzyutin.d/files/Varian_Hal___Microeconomic_Analysis__3d_edition__1992.pdf), or search Jehle and Reny for ""marginal rate of substitution.""

TL:DR if you're being precise, utility functions represent relative rankings of preferences, but not absolute levels of welfare.

For that reason, economists also don't think it makes sense to compare utilities across people.  If it doesn't mean much to say that I get four utils from an apple, and it doesn't mean much to say that you get five, then similarly, we can't compare our utilities.

This does not mean that economists think two people's valuation for an item is completely incommensurable.  We can compare how much money they are willing to pay for this item.  But this is not great as a welfare comparison, because it depends not only on their preferences, but also on how much money they have and what else they need it for.

Regardless, this market and some of the relevant questions have been of interest to me lately, so let me provide you with some thoughts but here are some notes. Warning, these do contain some hypotheticals, but so does your question of course.

*  It is important to remember that there will always be a delay in this openness and new houses hitting the market, whilst there is for many in the current-price demand pool (so the people who now want to buy) some urgency involved because they need to live/work in the region. Thus, it is not as if supply would drastically increase overnight. I found it hard to find data on how long it would take in the US to build a skyscraper, but I took [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Vanderbilt) as an example and in such a case it would take 4 years. Clearly, the avg. would be smaller and thus waiting times shorter, but a few years delay would not be weird. This is, by the way, completely disregarding any permit process.


*  That said, the damage depends a lot on which part of the housing price is speculative. In other words, to what extent are houses expensive because it is expected that demand remains high (and/or increases over time) and there will be no extra supply added. If this is a significant part, then that is a problem. I understand that this is at the core of your question, but I do not feel qualified making statements to what extent this holds for the region.


* A large difference is that the current value owners (largely) need to be involved with creating the extra supply. If we want to remove a block of houses and build a skyscraper, the current land owners need to be bought out. In this case, even, both the landowners and rentors should win; selling 10 with a markup of 100.000 USD is better than selling 1 with a 500.000USD markup, obviously. Of course the effects on the surrounding land prices will be negative, but my point is that a part of the profits get redistributed to the current owners. This is different from the late 2000's. There, the loss is much more similar to the previous point, namely a re-evaluation of their property made them realize they actually had a lot less than they thought.


*  Building limits are not solely decided by permits. If we take a map of the greater Los Angeles area and look at where most of the highly-valuable jobs are, there is only so far you can go. Los Angeles (county) is already [1/3rd](https://mapfight.appspot.com/la.county-vs-nl/los-angeles-county-california-netherlands-size-comparison) of the Netherlands. I'm not a citizen but traffic is already really bad and public transport is generally limited in the US. In other words, building outwards may not truely be an option.

*  Upwards, you will argue, then remains an option. Whilst true, this brings along new problems. As said before, infrastructure in major Californian cities can hardly handle a large influx of new people. We know that [commute times are heavily linked to housing prices](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Di-Pasquale-Urban-Economics-and-Real-Estate-Markets/PGM190808.html)(I am sorry, do not have proper paper on this, but it is to be found in this book. A good reference, and similar disection can be found [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119018300925)). An interesting visualization of this may be this research done by [zillow](https://public.tableau.com/views/CommutesHomeValuesandRentsanalysis/commutes_dash?:embed=y&:showVizHome=no&:host_url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F&:embed_code_version=3&:tabs=no&:toolbar=no&:animate_transition=yes&:display_static_image=no&:display_spinner=no&:display_overlay=yes&:display_count=yes&:refresh=yes&:revert=&:linktarget=&:loadOrderID=0). As the cities become more crowded, commute times per km increase. As a result, this land closer to the centers will increase in value. These are not the areas newly build and thus current land owners will see some of this increase.

*  Lastly, suddenly building a lot of houses requires a lot of manpower and machinery. Imagine that we all of the sudden can and want to destroy 100's of blocks of houses and replace them with appartement complexes. This requires construction companies as well as plumbers electricians etc. etc. Following a rising demand for their jobs, their wages will increase, thus resulting in increased costs for building (which may disincentivize building and thus reduce the loss in value), or it may create a lot of labor mobility (construction workers moving to California), thereby increasing demand.

Again, these are just some interesting things to think of and to get a discussion going. I could see a few of my points being rebutted by more specialized redditors here. Yet it is important to realize it is in essence different from the 2000's situation, where there was a sudden realization that their assets were worth less than projected. Surely there will be losses as this partially goes in this case as well, yet, it is not the case that tenants can tomorrow move to better houses with lower rents."

It is one of the axis of Marxist-Leninist thought that the state must be run by a single party system on behalf of the workers.

We shall keep it in economics, rather than politics, however.

Communism/Socialism often has the following economic traits. A planned economy (make x amount of food from these locations), no private ownership of 'the means of production' (usually means it's owned by the state), set prices, top-down production of goods.

They failed because they DID successfully force a socialist system onto a capitalist system, with set prices, no ownership of production, planned economies. They were successful communist economies (successful as in they managed to enforce all of the ideas of a communist economy).

What happened?

It turns out that a Communist economy doesn't work due to the following reasons:

 The removal of the profit motive meant that people didn't produce more than they had to, so they stopped. 

Top-down government instructions, in the case of China, led to the deaths of millions because of a combination of 1) Bad instructions to the farmers, and 2) Fear of disappointing their uppers meant they hid the results.

538,AutoModerator,removecomment,2019-07-17 21:32:52,t1_eu2vnxj,"""State capitalist"". Is this the word now being used? I'll keep this in the economic realm. The major communist states (U.S.S.R. and Mao's P.R.C.) were not democracies before, and were not democracies during Communism. It is one of the axis of Marxist-Leninist thought that the state must be run by a single party system on behalf of the workers.

We shall keep it in economics, rather than politics, however.

Communism/Socialism often has the following economic traits. A planned economy (make x amount of food from these locations), no private ownership of 'the means of production' (usually means it's owned by the state), set prices, top-down production of goods.

They failed because they DID successfully force a socialist system onto a capitalist system, with set prices, no ownership of production, planned economies. They were successful communist economies (successful as in they managed to enforce all of the ideas of a communist economy).

What happened?

It turns out that a Communist economy doesn't work due to the following reasons:

 The removal of the profit motive meant that people didn't produce more than they had to, so they stopped. 

Top-down government instructions, in the case of China, led to the deaths of millions because of a combination of 1) Bad instructions to the farmers, and 2) Fear of disappointing their uppers meant they hid the results. 

The lack of a market price system meant that the market couldn't adjust to a lack of food, so no imports, enforced exports (during the Great Leap Forward, China was exporting rice to Africa: [https://www.cairn-int.info/article-E\_AFCO\_237\_0071--china-s-agricultural-investments.htm](https://www.cairn-int.info/article-E_AFCO_237_0071--china-s-agricultural-investments.htm))

Rome had this habit of mixing their precious metal coins (silver, etc) with impurities such as nickel when collecting coins from taxation. This led to huge inflation around 200 AD by the fact that not only was there more coins in circulation, but more coins that were worth less. To fight this problem, emperor Diocletian, instead of addressing the currency issue, established price controls and also declared that those who practice a certain trade (farming, merchant, etc) would have to remain at that profession, as well as the next 2 generations of their offspring, punishable by death if not obeyed.

The following successors were also unable to fix Rome's inflation problem over the next 200 years, and the economy became so weak that soldiers were no longer getting paid and many revolted against Rome. At this point, barbarians and other Germanic Tribes needed only to make the final blow and bring Rome down.

This is why it is so important for governments across the world to not just print more money to fix their respective economies, especially since every currency in the world is tied to the US dollar, which itself is a Fiat Currency since untying the value of the Dollar to the value of gold in the 70's (you can thank Nixon for that).

In other words, if the US dollar fails one day (which it most likely will), then all currencies in the world will fail, and the world economy would tank at an unprecedented level. This is one of the main reasons for the US Government bailout of banks in 2008/2009.

What you want, instead, is something more like this: 

Suppose everyone starts out with some initial endowment of goods.  Person 1 asks everyone else what they'd like to swap (e.g. one orange for two grapes, or what have you).  The other players are free to accept or reject the offer to swap.  In theory, Person 1 would only offer a swap if he's willing to do it, i.e. he values what he's getting at least as much as what he's giving; and similarly, other people would accept the swap only if they value what they're getting as much as what they're giving.  Thus, if person 1 initially has lots of oranges and very few grapes, and would give up an orange (or more than one, if needed) for two grapes; while person 2 has few oranges and many grapes, and would give up two grapes (or more, if needed) for one orange -- then they can swap, and both end up liking their new bundle of goods better than the old one.

After Person 1 has offered everyone a chance to swap, Person 2 can go, and so on.  Keep going until everyone has had a chance to swap with everyone else, and there is nothing left that they still want to swap and haven't got around to.  

This is more or less how gains to trade work.  You need goods (or services, etc) to change hands, not just money."

My general argument is yes. Companies should pay their employees more as a profit rises. I think we should keep the labor capital ratio as in favor as labor as possible. I think evidence points that a a labor capital ratio that hovers at .75 share for labor historically results in more just and stable societies. Also for continued economic growth, I think feeding profits into the working class is also a smarter move. Who has a higher MPS and MPC? Someone with 50k salary or 5mil salary? I think we can all agree that the person with 50k is more likely to spend more of their additional income, so then we get a greater multiplier. 

Some people do argue that some of the reduction in the share of labor has been the rising cost of maintaining the capital stock.

This is a really good paper talking about wage growth, and it does a good job breaking down the historical patterns in wages. 

In terms of how realistic is raising wages, your secondary question, in our current environment in the USA, quite difficult, but doable. Unions are the classic and most effective way of workers claiming a larger piece of the pie of profits. Other ways are changing the ideological approach to capitalism. Some people advocate for stakeholder capitalism, where the workers, stakeholders in the economy, are viewed as just as important as the shareholders. A strain of historical though argues that part of the strong wage growth after WW2 through the 70s is that WW2 forced people of all classes to go through the intense and traumatic experience of WW2 together. This experience caused people when they entered the workforce and one infantry soldier became the owner and another to go to the factory floor for there to be more investment in the prosperity of the factory floor worker. Is it the whole story, probably not, but an interesting idea.

In terms of how realistic is raising wages, your secondary question, in our current environment in the USA, quite difficult, but doable. Unions are the classic and most effective way of workers claiming a larger piece of the pie of profits. Other ways are changing the ideological approach to capitalism. Some people advocate for stakeholder capitalism, where the workers, stakeholders in the economy, are viewed as just as important as the shareholders. A strain of historical though argues that part of the strong wage growth after WW2 through the 70s is that WW2 forced people of all classes to go through the intense and traumatic experience of WW2 together. This experience caused people when they entered the workforce and one infantry soldier became the owner and another to go to the factory floor for there to be more investment in the prosperity of the factory floor worker. Is it the whole story, probably not, but an interesting idea.

So at risk of revealing myself to be the socialist I am, I would recommend reading ""What do bosses even do?"" By Harvard economist Stephen Marglin ( [https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/marglin/files/review\_of\_radical\_political\_economics-1974-marglin-60-112\_0.pdf](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/marglin/files/review_of_radical_political_economics-1974-marglin-60-112_0.pdf) ). He raises an interesting investigation into the history of our current workplace hierarchy. Piketty's *Capital in the 21st Society* is a long treatise on the labor-capital split."

It's not realistic in a capitalist system. The cost of labor is just one component in producing a product or providing a service. If the argument is accepted that employees should be paid more simply because the company turned a profit you could just as easily argue they should have paid more for their water, gas, power, materials, waste, etc. Taken to the logical conclusion this would see all profits redistributed back to other entities than the company owners (either individuals or shareholders) and negate the concept of capitalism. 

The only reason a company pays an employee a particular wage or salary is because they cannot pay them less. Either because the employee will go to a competitor to be paid more or there are government regulations requiring that rate of pay, e.g. minimum wages. If the cost of that new employee exceeds the value a company can earn from the employee they will not be incentivized to hire them. Likewise, if all profits are simply redistributed to employees this removes the incentive to hire more employees."
581,DrunkenAsparagus,removecomment,2019-07-17 16:59:28,t1_eu1pvss,"Well, according to that logic the employees should earn less if the company is facing losses. This would result in unstable salaries. I guess stability matters more to people than temporary raises in salaries."

What we have in capitalism is an incentive structure and hardcore, cutthroat competition. If one company tries to be more moral than another the others will show higher profits, get more investments and obtain more market share. It's always in a firms interest to minimize labour costs, and it's always followed through on.

It's a fact that wages have massively dropped relative to profits.

Should a company pay more to its suppliers if it's doing well? Should an individual? If you get a raise at work, should your internet bill go up?

A job, to me, is an agreement to perform a well-defined task for a fixed rate of money. E.g. if I hire you to mow my lawn for $10, then if you mow my lawn you get $10. If I can't afford $10 then I still owe you $10. I have more money, I still owe you $10 - because that's the agreement we negotiated.

What we have in capitalism is an incentive structure and hardcore, cutthroat competition. If one company tries to be more moral than another the others will show higher profits, get more investments and obtain more market share. It's always in a firms interest to minimize labour costs, and it's always followed through on.

It's a fact that wages have massively dropped relative to profits.

It's not realistic in a capitalist system. The cost of labor is just one component in producing a product or providing a service. If the argument is accepted that employees should be paid more simply because the company turned a profit you could just as easily argue they should have paid more for their water, gas, power, materials, waste, etc. Taken to the logical conclusion this would see all profits redistributed back to other entities than the company owners (either individuals or shareholders) and negate the concept of capitalism. 

The only reason a company pays an employee a particular wage or salary is because they cannot pay them less. Either because the employee will go to a competitor to be paid more or there are government regulations requiring that rate of pay, e.g. minimum wages. If the cost of that new employee exceeds the value a company can earn from the employee they will not be incentivized to hire them. Likewise, if all profits are simply redistributed to employees this removes the incentive to hire more employees."

2. Those profits will stick because new good land can't be created to compete. 
3. All the profits go to the landowners not the workers because the market for workers is competitive.

My opinion, though, is no.

If a company is doing poorly, can it unilaterally decide to just pay it's employees less that month? 

Should a company pay more to its suppliers if it's doing well? Should an individual? If you get a raise at work, should your internet bill go up?

A job, to me, is an agreement to perform a well-defined task for a fixed rate of money. E.g. if I hire you to mow my lawn for $10, then if you mow my lawn you get $10. If I can't afford $10 then I still owe you $10. I have more money, I still owe you $10 - because that's the agreement we negotiated.

Maybe there is some argument that an employer-employee relationship should be more akin to being a family, but then, my opinion would be that the employees should have to take on some of the risks of the company too. E.g. if the company is doing poorly, it would be (legally) expected that employees should have to work through it and not be allowed to seek other employment. That sounds bad to me though."

First part. This is not really an /r/AskEconomics kind of question, but anyway:

Yes, they were state capitalist, or [state socialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_socialism), which is basically the same thing.


> If so, why do we call it communist?

Because they called themselves that. The called themselves that because in Marxism-Leninism, state socialism / state capitalism is the practical implementation of the [dictatorship of the proletariat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictatorship_of_the_proletariat) proposed by Marx and Engels, see Lenin's [The State and Revolution, 1917](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_State_and_Revolution).

Across the post-WWII Soviet network of allies, communist states generally controlled all access to raw material, all  production, and all ownership of capital goods (machines that produce products).  But, they generally (or eventually) allowed enough economic freedom that individuals could own small service businesses (like a laundromat) or operate as a merchant (as long as they obeyed the rules on price controls and sourced from the state agencies).

It's also important to keep in mind that ""communism"" is a variable term.  Marx and Engles never prescribed what a communist state would specifically look like.  Communism's history is very diverse just like Capitalism's.

Without diving into specifics, the general trend looked something like this:

* Revolution:  workers seize the means of production.
* Communism sets in: assets are distributed by force and become communal
* Market Reform: Central Planning fails for one reason or another, and the state is forced to relax the rules on price controls or other economic policies, the de-collectivization of agriculture often took place.
* Political Reform: Citizens gain some economic rights and start small businesses.

676,AutoModerator,removecomment,2019-07-16 17:59:50,t1_etxidko,"Claims about inequality being inherently good or bad either generally belong on philosophy subs or involve somewhat heterodox thinking.

It's a reasonably mainstream strain of thought that claims that when the rate of return on capital exceeds the rate of economic growth, inequality increases. Thomas Piketty elaborated on this in a recent book, Capital in the 21st Century, and I also came to a similar conclusion myself independently (I was pointed to this book by a friendly redditor when I wrote about this topic on a different sub).

But Piketty doesn't address why this is bad, or even worth looking at. When I wrote (*very* informally, I might add) I proposed that excessive inequality would be accompanied by excessive monopolization of industry, and that such monopolization would destroy the price system. The price system operates by allowing a vast multitude of independent decision makers to direct small pieces of the economy in experimental directions, allowing suppliers to at least roughly approximate actual demand curves and thus allow the market to seek out equilibrium. If the number of actors with control over capital drops too low, they begin to face similar problems to a central planning office: inadequate experimentation capacity and inadequate information.

A better way to think about it might be considering what Frederic Bastiat (19th century French economist) called ""the seen and the unseen"". He criticized other economists in his day for sometimes forgetting about or ignoring invisible effects of policy, and thus coined terms like the Broken Window Fallacy (breaking windows to stimulate economic activity doesn't normally* work because despite the ""seen"" -- people being forced to pay to get their windows fixed, thus increasing spending and giving the window maker more money and allowing him to now spend more, etc. -- it ignores the ""unseen"", the spending on other things which otherwise would probably have happened but instead was redirected to fixing the windows, thus canceling out any purported stimulative effect). The negative effect of this property destruction is no less real than the positive effect of spending to get the window fixed, but a bad economist would forget about the ""unseen"". ""Thinking at the margins"" refers to the peripheries of a situation, pretty much analogous to, in Bastiatian parlance, ""minding the unseen"".

At first glance, there is an obvious increase in competition. Because people can more easily change their providers, more people and more often there would be such switches. So, first we need to discuss how one provides an advantage over the other needs to be discussed. Then, we need to discuss what would be the reaction of the providers, e.g. how will they compete.

Let's say there are two categories of services that providers may provide: s(for standard services, such as messages and call minutes and internet through the lowest connection speed in the market , as in 1000mes+500min+2gb@50kbps=10$), and d(for differentiated services, a marginal differentiation than other providers, such as higher internet speed, e.g. 5G, or a bigger area that provider may serve in (I do not know if that is true for USA), or simply anything that a provider is unique in).

A consumer would compare s and d of different companies and settle on one. As time passes, these values must change, so a consumer would change his provider when the difference of the best package right now and old package that he uses right now exceeds his effort in changing the provider. To make things clear, let's say the effort; indicate status quo provider package with a 1, and status quo best alternative with a 2. Then a consumer would change his provider when :

(1) |s1+d1-s2-d2|>e

, when the effort is a positive value that  is the money equivalent of the time spent.

With this model, e decreases. The switching is subject to less advantage of a company than another.

Before getting to the reaction part, we need to further analyze these two categories of services. 

For s, there is an increasing cost of marginal difference. The technologies are there for the taking of companies, and the changes are much more uniform. You cannot probably make much of a difference with another cell tower, at least not right now. You can reduce profits, but that is discussed below. 

For an increase in d, we may say there are two ways: big capital investments, advertisement and its similars. The latter is much more easier to catch up, and therefore does grant only a permanent difference. The diffusion is much easier, talking from consumer experience. 

Yet capital investments are not. You can always get bigger, and despite of reduced returns, you can attract significantly more customers. You can spend a lot of money to increase your minimum internet speed from 50 kbps to 60, and due to reduced e, people would choose that. 


What will the companies do?

Companies may

a) reduce profit on s. 
b) increase d, 
   i) through long run investments. 
   ii) through short run perception changing campaigns, e.g. ads. 

For a, we need to consider the game theory. There are firms, and one firm reduces its prices, we do not know how the others will react. Is there a Nash equilibrium? Do firms have a dominant strategies? 
 
(I have no quantitative research on this area, so after this point, the argument is solely based on anectodal evidence.) 

Probably yes. I would say firms with bigger capitals, which would be able to reduce prices and increase d, would do so. In the end, I would say we would have a monopoly or an oligopoly. Probably an oligopoly at first, with high astronomically higher barriers of entry, and very intense product differentiation. For instance firm a would focus on internet, whereas firm b would have an advantage in international calls, and so on. But at the very end, the firms with the higher capitals would acquire smaller firms. Again, one or two huge firms that control the market... 

What is the difference if this model than the status quo? Not much. Only thing that I can think of is a significantly higher barrier of entry and furthered product differentiation. But for it to make a difference, the status quo would have to be difference. 

The main difference the model creates is that it accelerates the trend toward monopolization, or at least a Nash equilibrium. The biggest player, if can, would acquire many firms as possible with enough differentiation."

>Who would hire a teen for 15$/hr minimum wage over adults

This question applies to any entry-level position in any industry, hence isn't restricted to just minimum wage occupations. Employers don't just go off work experience, they go off a persons CV and educational background and can generally gauge the competency of potential employees.

>Wouldn't big companies automate jobs away? Like McDonald and their kiosks very few cashier now.

Automation isn't something that just ""happens"". Those kiosks are still very faulty and have a lot of problems, and even if those jobs are automated, the kitchens still require people to work in them, as automation is still decades away from being able to automate what appears to be a simple task like burger flipping.

>Wouldn't this hurt small businesses since they can't afford to hire? So wouldn't this cause inflation? Only benefiting the big companies to automate?

The short answer is no, minimum wage increases don't cause inflation, at least not very much, and certainly not as much as other major factors. There is also not a lot of evidence to suggest that small businesses are hurt in the long run by minimum wage increases, although some cuts to jobs and lower job growth do occur in the short run in response to increases in minimum wage.

>  How are we going to deal with automation and the lost of jobs?

When automation drastically reduces the number of people needed to work in an industry (say fabric manufacturing for instance), two things happen: those people lose their jobs, and new jobs are possible because society is now no longer tying up its time producing fabric inefficiently. Automation doesn't just cause ""lost jobs"", it also creates economic opportunity and tends to generate the ability for new work to be done. Technological change over the past 250 years has always been met with fear over how it will destroy the economy, but it has yet to happen."

Edit: I’m not going to talk about the Phillips Curve and it’s validity here, but you seem to claim“it hurts employment for small businesses” and that  it would therefore lead to inflation, which just doesn’t follow logically.

That study found that incomes Rose and there were no adverse effects on employment.

Surely, *some* incentive to automate tasks is increased. But there is also increased buying power, which leads to increased sales, which generates demand for labor.

The real challenge here is that certain segments of workers are more impacted than others. For example, low skilled employees who perform repetitive tasks are in danger of having their work automated away. Despite this subs position on automation, this is definitely a problem, but it's not a problem for the economy writ large so much as it is a problem for select groups. 

Small businesses should not be impacted significantly, because minimum wage increases impact all employers. This means costs are transferred to customers, and all competitors are forced to raise prices, generally in lockstep."

Those kiosks are still very faulty and have a lot of problems, and even if those jobs are automated, the kitchens still require people to work in them, as automation is still decades away from being able to automate what appears to be a simple task like burger flipping.

>Wouldn't this hurt small businesses since they can't afford to hire? So wouldn't this cause inflation? Only benefiting the big companies to automate?

The short answer is no, minimum wage increases don't cause inflation, at least not very much, and certainly not as much as other major factors. There is also not a lot of evidence to suggest that small businesses are hurt in the long run by minimum wage increases, although some cuts to jobs and lower job growth do occur in the short run in response to increases in minimum wage.

>  How are we going to deal with automation and the lost of jobs?

When automation drastically reduces the number of people needed to work in an industry (say fabric manufacturing for instance), two things happen: those people lose their jobs, and new jobs are possible because society is now no longer tying up its time producing fabric inefficiently. Automation doesn't just cause ""lost jobs"", it also creates economic opportunity and tends to generate the ability for new work to be done. Technological change over the past 250 years has always been met with fear over how it will destroy the economy, but it has yet to happen."

This is the main practical reason that money in the present is more valuable than money in the future (the interest rate being due to a combination of a fee to borrow money, a compensation for the fact that you have to have money later rather than now, and a representation of the opportunity cost of doing something productive with that money). Money in the future cannot be invested now, so it gathers less interest in its lifetime, and that makes it less valuable than money you have and can invest now. So present money is relatively more valuable than future money based on the interest rate.

If the interest rate falls, then the mechanism that makes the present worth more than the future is diminished, such that future income is not as discounted as present income is.

Imagine I have 100 dollars today and will get 100 more next year. If the interest rate is 7%, I can invest it today and next year I will have $107, 7 dollars more than if I just got 100 dollars next year, so while my income stayed the same this year and next, this year’s income is worth more. Now imagine the interest rate is 2% instead of 7%. If I invest that same 100 today, next year I will have $102 which is only 2 dollars more than getting 100 next year. When the interest rate fell, the real difference between this and next year’s income becomes less pronounced, in that the proportion by which present income is worth more than future income decreases, and therefore, future income is relatively worth more.

Basically, the interest rate is a measure of how much more important the present is than the future. If it’s higher, the present becomes even more important, and if lower, its importance decreases."

The real challenge here is that certain segments of workers are more impacted than others.

Despite this subs position on automation, this is definitely a problem, but it's not a problem for the economy writ large so much as it is a problem for select groups.

So, be prepared for tests that aren't that difficult, but are insanely hard to prepare yourself for, which means that you're virtually always under-prepared. 

You should decide soon into the semester whether your professor is a good one or not, and if he's not, be sure to study outside of class every day, because his class will be useless but you still need to pass. 

&#x200B;

As for econ being a mix of history and math, that's sort of true. Frankly, for undergrad economics, you only need to know how to take derivatives. The rest of the math is simple algebra involving specific equations. It's mostly interpreting equations and knowing how to implement them. This isn't mentioning econometrics, which is just using statistics to find relationships in data. Definitely take all the econometrics courses you can. You might find them the most boring, but they're the most sought after skill an econ undergrad can have. A good bet for you would be to get a math minor and an econ major.

This is actually an interesting question. It makes sense that a large deposit could be as good as if not better than pay stubs, as a signal of ability to make rent. And I'm sure that in some cases it is actually done, e.g. when someone is temporarily out of work but has a lot of cash. 

But think about how large the deposit would need to be to really cover the liability of several months of rent, especially considering how long it takes to evict a tenant.

> Also, why isn't there more of a market for cheap rental apartments?

This is a much more complicated question. The basic answer is that, in general, people have a high willingness to pay for new construction. So if you're building a new building, people are already willing to pay a premium. And the buyers who are buying new construction--and willing to pay a premium for it--will also pay for more space, better finishes, nicer amenities, etc. So new construction tends to target that segment.

It's kind of how people don't build huge houses with bare bones finishes; rather, size and quality are complements. And the age of a home is an attribute that people are willing to pay for.

In general, most cheaper housing isn't built as such but rather begins as more expensive housing that becomes cheaper over time through depreciation. This is called ""filtering"" in real estate, as new, premium housing filters through over time into the lower-end of the market. 

Finally, there are regulatory barriers. Sometimes zoning laws mandate minimum sizes of units. And there are fixed costs of construction--regardless of quality--that drive up the price as well, so it naturally makes sense to target it toward a more premium market."

The main problem is that if everyone is rich and subject to low prices, that must mean everyone has a good purchasing power. And also that their purchasing powers do not deviate much.

Yet such an approach does not account for the changes in production. So, the purchasing power or 'richness' of a construction worker is multiples of the richness of his counterpart a century ago. This is true for almost everywhere on the globe.

My point is that being rich is a relative concept. When we account for every individual in society having a similar purchasing power, there must be at least a sort of societal mechanism that ensures that (this is an assumption). The handicap is that such a societal mechanism, and also the inability to individually get much richer are factors that obstacle the development of production. That must mean that in such a society, there is no similar incentive to innovate (if you think such incentives are what makes the status quo get cheaper).

From the liberal view point, that is highly unlikely.

From a counter view point, that does not really matter. Development in time... is that really important? Does that directly correlate with people's happiness?

I would argue that in an equalistic society, the drive for innovation must be channeled to something other than money, such as nationalism, or simple humanistic feelings. Such a scenario is not very close to common sense. Yet it is possible.

In summary, I offer two alternatives:
If you determine a criteria for being rich, an equaliterian society would be able to provide that example. But it cannot accelerate development, or it may not develop. So the change in terms of purchasing power would stagnate relative to that of a liberal society. 

Though high purchasing power may not be very important, as it does not guarantee a high happiness. Maybe being equal and being more human, being less money, and competition-oriented may prove to be more contributing to people's happiness.

In 2018 it grew to 25,300 $billions

&#x200B;

Does it mean that real output, growth in productivity, economy grew by almost 9%

Nominal grew by ""only"" 6,6%, but as I understand it correctly nominal is all output in China in yuans, converted to dollars based on dollar to yuan exchange rates at particular year.

&#x200B;

Because US dollar is a benchmark, PPP growth is always the same as nominal.

US GDP grew by 3,1% in 2018.

&#x200B;

So China output is growing 3 times as fast as in US, not 2 as most media are reporting. USA  can buy more stuff from international markets using strong dollar,  China not so much, but since they are manufacturing everything it is not  a big problem for them.

&#x200B;

China  does not buy weapons from US (like most countries) so nominal is also  irrelevant here. They are developing them on their own, so if they  invest the same % on defence as US, because their PPP is already  significantly larger, they could easily develop more new jets, tanks,  aircraft carriers, rockets, fund their equivalent of DARPA, space  program etc.

&#x200B;

The  same with science and technology, if they increase spending to 2,7% of  GDP(like US), their innovation industry will have much larger output  than US.

At first glance, there is an obvious increase in competition. Because people can more easily change their providers, more people and more often there would be such switches. So, first we need to discuss how one provides an advantage over the other needs to be discussed. Then, we need to discuss what would be the reaction of the providers, e.g. how will they compete.

Let's say there are two categories of services that providers may provide: s(for standard services, such as messages and call minutes and internet through the lowest connection speed in the market , as in 1000mes+500min+2gb@50kbps=10$), and d(for differentiated services, a marginal differentiation than other providers, such as higher internet speed, e.g. 5G, or a bigger area that provider may serve in (I do not know if that is true for USA), or simply anything that a provider is unique in).

A consumer would compare s and d of different companies and settle on one. As time passes, these values must change, so a consumer would change his provider when the difference of the best package right now and old package that he uses right now exceeds his effort in changing the provider. To make things clear, let's say the effort; indicate status quo provider package with a 1, and status quo best alternative with a 2. Then a consumer would change his provider when :

(1) |s1+d1-s2-d2|>e

, when the effort is a positive value that  is the money equivalent of the time spent.

With this model, e decreases. The switching is subject to less advantage of a company than another.

Before getting to the reaction part, we need to further analyze these two categories of services. 

For s, there is an increasing cost of marginal difference. The technologies are there for the taking of companies, and the changes are much more uniform. You cannot probably make much of a difference with another cell tower, at least not right now. You can reduce profits, but that is discussed below. 

For an increase in d, we may say there are two ways: big capital investments, advertisement and its similars. The latter is much more easier to catch up, and therefore does grant only a permanent difference. The diffusion is much easier, talking from consumer experience. 

Yet capital investments are not. You can always get bigger, and despite of reduced returns, you can attract significantly more customers. You can spend a lot of money to increase your minimum internet speed from 50 kbps to 60, and due to reduced e, people would choose that. 


What will the companies do?

Companies may

a) reduce profit on s. 
b) increase d, 
   i) through long run investments. 
   ii) through short run perception changing campaigns, e.g. ads. 

For a, we need to consider the game theory. There are firms, and one firm reduces its prices, we do not know how the others will react. Is there a Nash equilibrium? Do firms have a dominant strategies? 
 
(I have no quantitative research on this area, so after this point, the argument is solely based on anectodal evidence.) 

Probably yes. I would say firms with bigger capitals, which would be able to reduce prices and increase d, would do so. In the end, I would say we would have a monopoly or an oligopoly. Probably an oligopoly at first, with high astronomically higher barriers of entry, and very intense product differentiation. For instance firm a would focus on internet, whereas firm b would have an advantage in international calls, and so on. But at the very end, the firms with the higher capitals would acquire smaller firms. Again, one or two huge firms that control the market... 

What is the difference if this model than the status quo? Not much. Only thing that I can think of is a significantly higher barrier of entry and furthered product differentiation. But for it to make a difference, the status quo would have to be difference. 

The main difference the model creates is that it accelerates the trend toward monopolization, or at least a Nash equilibrium. The biggest player, if can, would acquire many firms as possible with enough differentiation."

The main problem is that if everyone is rich and subject to low prices, that must mean everyone has a good purchasing power. And also that their purchasing powers do not deviate much.

Yet such an approach does not account for the changes in production. So, the purchasing power or 'richness' of a construction worker is multiples of the richness of his counterpart a century ago. This is true for almost everywhere on the globe.

My point is that being rich is a relative concept. When we account for every individual in society having a similar purchasing power, there must be at least a sort of societal mechanism that ensures that (this is an assumption). The handicap is that such a societal mechanism, and also the inability to individually get much richer are factors that obstacle the development of production. That must mean that in such a society, there is no similar incentive to innovate (if you think such incentives are what makes the status quo get cheaper).

From the liberal view point, that is highly unlikely.

From a counter view point, that does not really matter. Development in time... is that really important? Does that directly correlate with people's happiness?

I would argue that in an equalistic society, the drive for innovation must be channeled to something other than money, such as nationalism, or simple humanistic feelings. Such a scenario is not very close to common sense. Yet it is possible.

In summary, I offer two alternatives:
If you determine a criteria for being rich, an equaliterian society would be able to provide that example. But it cannot accelerate development, or it may not develop. So the change in terms of purchasing power would stagnate relative to that of a liberal society. 

Though high purchasing power may not be very important, as it does not guarantee a high happiness. Maybe being equal and being more human, being less money, and competition-oriented may prove to be more contributing to people's happiness. 

I think question must be revised so to have a narrower domain. 
I am open to debate."

799,DutchPhenom,removecomment,2019-07-15 04:16:21,t1_etkkgei,"Frankly economic theory comes up short in telling us what a minimum wage would do, hence the disagreement. It's better to look at the finding of specific studies. The [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/wiki/faq_minwage) has a few of the major ones linked and a [fresh new study](https://irle.berkeley.edu/minimum-wage-effects-in-low-wage-areas/) was just published about a week ago. In general, I'd say the findings are that a minimum wage hike wouldn't adversely affect employment levels. If we raise it all at once, it would probably be a different story, but no one is suggesting that so it's nothing but a straw man. 

Anyone that says that the USA is saliently different than any other first world economy is a person that wants to believe what they want to believe and will go on believing it in the face of whatever facts are presented. 

I think it was the Card and Kruger study that found that a 40% increase in minimum wage corresponded with a 4% increase in prices. To my knowledge not a single study has been published that shows that a minimum wage would increase prices dramatically. This is intuitive also since labor is only a part of the costs that go into your food. It's just impossible for a 50% increase in labor cost to increase the cost of the product by 50%. The common concern that comes up is an increase in unemployment, not price increases. 

I'm sorry your ""friends"" are like that. It's a bit absurd to be making fun of someone for a belief on a topic where they clearly do not know much about the field at all. I think they need a reminder of this -- that they are only regurgitating other peoples' ideas. Ideas that they have cherry picked according to their own value systems. My advice would be to read the studies, or at least the findings in the studies and use that as your ammunition. If they try to pull out some basic introductory economics crap, remind them according to economic theory, there is no consensus because it's just too hard to tell. 

Don't forget, it's also perfectly reasonable to believe that humans deserve a certain wage, regardless of the effect on the economy. The law is meant to be imbued with our values. It's not just there to protect property rights."

803,DutchPhenom,removecomment,2019-07-15 04:09:08,t1_etg578y,"I think the two are intertwined. Computer chips and other electronics going down in price is largely a result of engineers gaining experience in the manufacture in electronic components combined with economies of scale as production quantities increase. You see similar things happen in other industries like textiles and farming, as engineers continually innovate newer, quicker, cheaper machines. If everyone in a market is continually upgrading, than the market leans towards price rather than qualitative competition - leading to commoditization and lower prices for consumers.

On the flip side, cheaper electronic chips and computing power has made made workers more productive. Another way of thinking about this is the opportunity cost of an hour of labor relative to other goods that can be produced. If cheaper computing power and automation has led to a single manufacturing employee to increase the value of their time from 10 chips an hour to 30 chips an hour, the ratio of manufacturing goods to service goods that can be produced in a single employee hour goes up - so in essence the cost of things like teachers, doctors, lawyers, scientists goes up in terms of computer chips. Because the input chain of drugs are the result of education, scientific research, doctors and lawyers all coming together to put a product on the market - all of these jobs have been relatively resistant to automation, the cost of labor for drugs has gone up significantly relative to computer chips.

Another important factor might be winner-take-all effects in both markets. Computer chips, in a relatively competitive market that competes on price have been incentivized to cut costs in order to avoid being outcompeted by others. Drug companies, who exist in a market in which only the newest, best drug is prescribed - are incentivized to put out the best possible product they can - regardless of price."

The microchip was patented in the US in 1964 with a 17 year expiration. The tech companies that make today's processors and computer chip use the microchip foundation but don't infringe on each other's technology by differentiation. An Intel chip doesn't work the same as an AMD chip. The microchip was a one and done patent whereas somthing like Insulin has a complex and complicated past. 

The original patent already expired but with the combination of new patents on methods for synthesizing and delivering insulin AND regulations (which lead to 1. expensive clinical testing and 2. prevents new entrants into the market), Insulin doesn't have a competitive market. The established big player(s) can redesign all aspects of Insulin and file patents for every change. And with that, they unilaterally decide to discontinue their older versions to basically restrict buyer choice. It's all about availability of substitutes. Also looking at the 2 industries, which is going to be heavily regulated and arguably rightfully so?

This is another way to think about it. Take the 2 categories, Computer products and Drugs.

So not everyone can be wealthy at least how we would define it. A good example is how living standards are rising all throughout history. The poorest homeowning individual in the US leads a much better life in terms of consumer goods, life expectancy, etc than the poorest homeowning individual used to even as early as the 40s or 50s. We don't identify that person as wealthy however and that's because everyone is as wealthy or wealthier than them. Wealth is a relative term in regards to either lifestyle or purchasing power. As long as there is a market there will be a person who can afford the most stuff and the person who can afford the least stuff thus there will be no such thing as universal wealth.


Now on to your second question about cheap goods and services. I would apply the logic of a supply/demand curve(sorry for not linking a graph). Essentially the price of an good/service is dependent on what the demand of the item is and how much of that item is available to go around. At the most basic level for an item to be cheap there needs to be a large supply available for purchase where demand is met or even exceeded. Now whether this will happen to all goods and services depends on the future of the world and how much of a futurist you are. Automation and ai is advancing and so some notable people believe we will eventually be able to get any item at an extremely efficient process in a world where resources and raw materials are widely available from efficient mining either on Earth or in space. I tend to be more skeptical when it comes to this futuristic thought especially when it comes to services, but we will eventually see.



I know that's not a super clear answer, but do take stock in the fact that people's lives are improving every year by a ton of different metrics and in the future anything we consider expensive and rare but also potentially vital will be made cheaply available(just look at cell phones, televisions, or microwaves).

This is the main practical reason that money in the present is more valuable than money in the future (the interest rate being due to a combination of a fee to borrow money, a compensation for the fact that you have to have money later rather than now, and a representation of the opportunity cost of doing something productive with that money). Money in the future cannot be invested now, so it gathers less interest in its lifetime, and that makes it less valuable than money you have and can invest now. So present money is relatively more valuable than future money based on the interest rate.

If the interest rate falls, then the mechanism that makes the present worth more than the future is diminished, such that future income is not as discounted as present income is.

Imagine I have 100 dollars today and will get 100 more next year. If the interest rate is 7%, I can invest it today and next year I will have $107, 7 dollars more than if I just got 100 dollars next year, so while my income stayed the same this year and next, this year’s income is worth more. Now imagine the interest rate is 2% instead of 7%. If I invest that same 100 today, next year I will have $102 which is only 2 dollars more than getting 100 next year. When the interest rate fell, the real difference between this and next year’s income becomes less pronounced, in that the proportion by which present income is worth more than future income decreases, and therefore, future income is relatively worth more.

Basically, the interest rate is a measure of how much more important the present is than the future. If it’s higher, the present becomes even more important, and if lower, its importance decreases."

You might scoff, but just hear me out, free speech also applies to the ""socialist"" that I am (even though I'm a social democrat, not a socialist). Let's have a civil discussion about this topic.

In my view it's great that people like Bernie Sanders are fighting to raise the minimum wage for employees working for large corporations like Amazon (that passed it), Walmart, and McDonald's. A raise would allow a higher purchasing power to people which is beneficial. People need an effective raise in income to compete in the modern economy. (I personally agree more with a UBI approach which is what Andrew Yang is offering to the table, but still think Sanders will be the better candidate to take on Donald Trump.)

The problem is that if corporations raise their minimum wage, an inevitable consequence would be that more people would want to work for those companies rather than working at a local store which can only pay, say, $9 and hour, thus hurting the small business.

If we raise the minimum wage to $15/hour nation wide, more people would want to work for those large corporations as well.

Can someone explain a good counter argument and point me to a credible article or study which shows how we can effectively raise the minimum wage to $15/ hour, while not hurting small business?

I looked at the Economic Policy Institute, and all I could find was this:

[https://www.epi.org/publication/why-america-needs-a-15-minimum-wage/](https://www.epi.org/publication/why-america-needs-a-15-minimum-wage/)

Pretty good analysis but doesn't address the hurt it causes to small business.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Here's a somewhat insightful response I got earlier for this very question:

""Honestly, I think the reason you can't find a good counter argument to that direct issue is because there are not really any available. Not in the way I think you are looking for anyway. But this is how I feel the balance of a minimum wage makes sense. 

&#x200B;

""The balance against the free market principle that a job is worth what the market will pay for it is that the wider economy needs that low paying, often undesirable or unskilled jobs, to be done. If we want them done, it is fair to expect that worker is able to live off that wage if the job is full time and limits their ability to supplement their income with another source. If a small business cannot make good enough use out of a worker under those conditions, that their business will be in a net benefit situation after using that persons labor, they need to find a different way to solve their problem. The grey area is actually the aspect of full time. This would be much easier if we could say, well Bob's small business only needs a few hours help, and Sarah can do that and they are both happy with her being paid $10 per hour, so lets make an exemption for small business to pay a lower hourly wage for part time roles. The issue is that this has historically just driven business, of all sizes, including ones that can easily afford the $15, to just hire everyone under part time contracts. An example can be seen all over the world with ""Contract"" workers, where someone essentially runs their own business and is contracted exclusively to an employer, actors might be a good example of where that is appropriate. This gives the employer the right to stop providing contracted work at any stage if they don't have it. While this is a necessary construct it has led to thousands upon thousands of workers being employed as ""contractors"" even though their function is essentially an exclusive full time employee. The same thing would inevitably happen if an exemption was made to small businesses.

&#x200B;

""Sorry that is not a nice little argument to counter the issue, it's just one of those complex things where some harm is done in the pursuit of a greater good.

People want to consume those goods and services. So you will always have to give up ""something"" in exchange for those goods and services, and if there are a relatively large number of people who want a relatively small number of goods or services, you will have to give up more ""something"" than the other people who want them.

(Rationing to keep the monetary price down tends to drive the ""something you give up"" up in other ways, often time. Think if people looking up more than a day in advance to get concert tickets: This tickets are costing them *far* more than the advertised price.)

But that's ""expensive"" relative to other goods and services. As technology gets better and we get better at producing things, they do get cheaper so that we can consume more overall. For example, my dad talks about getting a burger, fries and milkshake from McDonald's for 80 cents, but he made 65 cents an hour. That same meal would cost about 6 dollars today, but minimum wage is over 7 an hour. So it takes less than an hour to get the same meal that took about one and a third hours back then, leaving you with with the ability to get more on the same income today.

As far as everyone being wealthy, that really depends on what you're comparing against to determine what is ""wealthy."" If we compare a person today with people a century ago, everyone is fabulously wealthy.  If you compare America today with the average person in the world today, pretty much everyone in America is wealthy. But ""wealthy"" is a relative term. If you waved a magic wand and redistributed all the wealth in the US exactly equally, most people would be better off than they were yesterday but nobody would be wealthy compared to other Americans because they all have the same.

So it's possible for everybody to have a standard of living similar to what a wealthy person today has. But there are still limited resources, so some people will have things that others cannot get, so there will also always be inequality."

Theoretically, assuming perfect competition, the minimum wage would stabilize at some equilibrium point where the supply of labor meets the demand for labor (standard Econ theory). Realistically and logically, the jobs that would take the greatest hit would be low-skilled jobs. I envision two different scenarios.

Scenario 1: In this market, labor supply for unskilled labor would be enormous and so firms would be able to get by, by offering lower and lower wages and firing employees who refused to work at those lower wages. That wage would probably be pushed down significantly below what minimum wage currently stands at. Meanwhile, higher paying jobs would be hardly affected, and therefore income inequality would grow. (I’m holding all else equal: housing prices, inflation, etc as a result of abolished minimum wage). 

Scenario 2: Because minimum wage as is, is already incredibly low and unsustainable for families, unskilled workers (especially those who had families) would be unwilling to work at wages lower than minimum wage. So I predict families would start emigrating out of America, the unskilled-single labor market would potentially rise, and the demand for education (in pursuit of higher wages) would rise significantly. This might accompany simultaneously (or maybe alternatively) a shortage in labor supply, forcing companies that hire low-skilled workers to pay a wage that would likely be close to the actual minimum wage."

As a result, you will have effects both on the demand side and the supply side.

>If so, what exactly keeps their wages from falling to the minimum wage?

The minimum wage is not relevant for all jobs. Highly valuable jobs which require a lot of talent only have a limited pool thus require competition from firms. Imagine, for example, that a high quality copyright lawyer could save a big company 1 million USD a year, and only a few of these lawyers are to be found. Obviously, if company A only offers minimum wage, company B will offer more. In this way we reach an equilibrium.

> If not, then why is the law needed at all?

Because not every job is the same. Perhaps there are many people available to do certain odd-jobs, and society thinks that these people should earn a certain set amount at a minimum for a job done (for example, enough to live on one job). Basically, we could argue that the equilibrium we reach is too low, or unfair. For these people, a raise in the minimum wage will be a raise in their earnings.

This is really relatively basic textbook stuff. What you seem to miss is that not every job is the same. The minimum wage only targets certain jobs at the lower end of the earnings spectrum.

Does this answer your question?"

People want to consume those goods and services. So you will always have to give up ""something"" in exchange for those goods and services, and if there are a relatively large number of people who want a relatively small number of goods or services, you will have to give up more ""something"" than the other people who want them.

(Rationing to keep the monetary price down tends to drive the ""something you give up"" up in other ways, often time. Think if people looking up more than a day in advance to get concert tickets: This tickets are costing them *far* more than the advertised price.)

But that's ""expensive"" relative to other goods and services. As technology gets better and we get better at producing things, they do get cheaper so that we can consume more overall. For example, my dad talks about getting a burger, fries and milkshake from McDonald's for 80 cents, but he made 65 cents an hour. That same meal would cost about 6 dollars today, but minimum wage is over 7 an hour. So it takes less than an hour to get the same meal that took about one and a third hours back then, leaving you with with the ability to get more on the same income today.

As far as everyone being wealthy, that really depends on what you're comparing against to determine what is ""wealthy."" If we compare a person today with people a century ago, everyone is fabulously wealthy.  If you compare America today with the average person in the world today, pretty much everyone in America is wealthy. But ""wealthy"" is a relative term. If you waved a magic wand and redistributed all the wealth in the US exactly equally, most people would be better off than they were yesterday but nobody would be wealthy compared to other Americans because they all have the same.

So it's possible for everybody to have a standard of living similar to what a wealthy person today has. But there are still limited resources, so some people will have things that others cannot get, so there will also always be inequality."

One thing that will differ in your model is that the marginal income from labour isn't increasing, the income itself is increasing. As a result, you will have effects both on the demand side and the supply side. In particular, consumers will have higher base incomes independent of their hours worked and may choose to cut their hours as a result.

So not everyone can be wealthy at least how we would define it. A good example is how living standards are rising all throughout history. The poorest homeowning individual in the US leads a much better life in terms of consumer goods, life expectancy, etc than the poorest homeowning individual used to even as early as the 40s or 50s. We don't identify that person as wealthy however and that's because everyone is as wealthy or wealthier than them. Wealth is a relative term in regards to either lifestyle or purchasing power. As long as there is a market there will be a person who can afford the most stuff and the person who can afford the least stuff thus there will be no such thing as universal wealth.


Now on to your second question about cheap goods and services. I would apply the logic of a supply/demand curve(sorry for not linking a graph). Essentially the price of an good/service is dependent on what the demand of the item is and how much of that item is available to go around. At the most basic level for an item to be cheap there needs to be a large supply available for purchase where demand is met or even exceeded. Now whether this will happen to all goods and services depends on the future of the world and how much of a futurist you are. Automation and ai is advancing and so some notable people believe we will eventually be able to get any item at an extremely efficient process in a world where resources and raw materials are widely available from efficient mining either on Earth or in space. I tend to be more skeptical when it comes to this futuristic thought especially when it comes to services, but we will eventually see.



I know that's not a super clear answer, but do take stock in the fact that people's lives are improving every year by a ton of different metrics and in the future anything we consider expensive and rare but also potentially vital will be made cheaply available(just look at cell phones, televisions, or microwaves). Those used to be luxury goods but now are commonplace and with the exception of the newest iPhone isn't a sign of wealth. That's the best answer I got, hope I was able to help."

For simplicity, imagine that the only thing Zimbabweans need is bread, and there’s a certain amount of bread in Zimbabwe. There’s also a lot of notes with numbers printed on them, and we accept that these notes can be exchanged for bread. If we add up all the numbers on the notes, and divide by the number of loaves of bread, we know how many notes we need to get a single loaf of bread.

Now suppose I print a whole lot more notes. Can I afford more bread? Two things to think about. First, the total quantity of notes has gone up, so the average price of bread must have risen (assuming everyone knows how many notes and how many loaves there are). Second, I (the person who printed the notes) now have a larger share of the total notes. So I can afford more bread, but it’s come at the expense of everyone else being able to afford less.

This is more or less what the Zimbabwean government did. Of course, very few people know exactly how many notes and how many loaves exist in our toy economy, but they sure do notice that notes are becoming more plentiful, but bread is not. So the price does indeed rise, and this we call inflation. The reason it’s bad is not because the number on the notes has some special meaning, but because the notes that people had are now worth less (because the government suddenly has a whole lot more notes). There has been a *transfer of wealth* from people who hold money to people who print it.

On the other hand, if the government had one day declared that henceforth Z$1 = Z$10, and updated everyone’s wallets, bank balances, and contracts accordingly, this would have had no effect at all.

So I hope this makes clear that it’s the mechanism of inflation that matters, not the inflation per se."

With the lower cost they have with workers and the products they use from other companies that also use cheap labor, they can sell their products with lower costs than smaller local competitors back home - who eventually close their doors - and have higher profit by gaining a wider market from business that can not compete with the Chinese prices. So the conclusion taken is that everyone benefits with products with lower prices, so poor people can have nice stuffs that before was a privilege of those better off.

On the other hand, when money is concentrate on the hands of fewer less money is circulating in the economy, because rich people don't spend all their money  but keep most of it in banks and financial, and speculative market, earning money from dividends without producing nothing, which effects the economy creating unemployment effecting specially lower classes, empty homes with over prices that average families barely can afford while many people have to stay in the streets or move somewhere else.

As a ""solution"", the government may create more/cheaper credit (which means debt) in order to inject money in the economy and keep people buying and business producing. As well as loose the employment laws so employers can pay less and give less job security in order to keep hiring, producing and have lower incomers with some money to pay their bills, even if it means they need more than 1 or 2 jobs for that.

&#x200B;

It's not a good solution though. The lower incomers spend most and often all of their income, which means they create more demand and more jobs when they have better income. The rich increasing their wealth only concentrate money out of the productive market.

&#x200B;

The good economic performance of a country little matter the wealth ones. They actually are making more money during economic crises than when their country are in good economic performance. During crises is when the small competitor close their doors and the big business and speculators can buy and gain more market. The thing that most people won't tell you is that everybody likes competition and free market when they want have easy access to one, but also everybody hates competition and free market when it's full of competitors which business have to compete harder for customers and which drive prices down making the business less profitable (or in some cases not profitable at all unless you find a specialized market in demand that other competitors don't have easy access) - It's the law of self preservation and self-perpetuation. In every industry I have worked I never saw a business celebrating because they have more competitors but the contrary, they wish, lobby and vote for politicians who creates more bureaucracy that make it harder for new competitors enter in the market, therefore keeping it profitable for those who are in.

The reason I say it is impossible not to have a large lower class is due to the systems implemented worldwide. If the value of wages and such increase enough so that there is no poverty in 2019, the costs of goods such as food, land, and other basics will increase due to higher demand. Inflation would erode all the gains made and in relative purchasing power, you are back to where you started within several years. 

Now it is possible to bridge the income inequality gap, but it starts by asking 2 questions. What is the maximum wealth any person or company can have besides infinity (like it is today)? What is the minimum wealth any person should have to have a dignified quality of life?"
962,AutoModerator,removecomment,2019-07-14 12:01:23,t1_etqx4p4,"Large lower class drives their wages down, consequently employers have lower costs which depending on the competition also drive prices down of goods and services down. Take the Chinese labor market wage as example, which attracts manufacture industry specially from where the labor cost is higher such as Europe and US. With the lower cost they have with workers and the products they use from other companies that also use cheap labor, they can sell their products with lower costs than smaller local competitors back home - who eventually close their doors - and have higher profit by gaining a wider market from business that can not compete with the Chinese prices. So the conclusion taken is that everyone benefits with products with lower prices, so poor people can have nice stuffs that before was a privilege of those better off.

On the other hand, when money is concentrate on the hands of fewer less money is circulating in the economy, because rich people don't spend all their money  but keep most of it in banks and financial, and speculative market, earning money from dividends without producing nothing, which effects the economy creating unemployment effecting specially lower classes, empty homes with over prices that average families barely can afford while many people have to stay in the streets or move somewhere else.

As a ""solution"", the government may create more/cheaper credit (which means debt) in order to inject money in the economy and keep people buying and business producing. As well as loose the employment laws so employers can pay less and give less job security in order to keep hiring, producing and have lower incomers with some money to pay their bills, even if it means they need more than 1 or 2 jobs for that.

&#x200B;

It's not a good solution though. The lower incomers spend most and often all of their income, which means they create more demand and more jobs when they have better income. The rich increasing their wealth only concentrate money out of the productive market.

&#x200B;

The good economic performance of a country little matter the wealth ones. They actually are making more money during economic crises than when their country are in good economic performance. During crises is when the small competitor close their doors and the big business and speculators can buy and gain more market. The thing that most people won't tell you is that everybody likes competition and free market when they want have easy access to one, but also everybody hates competition and free market when it's full of competitors which business have to compete harder for customers and which drive prices down making the business less profitable (or in some cases not profitable at all unless you find a specialized market in demand that other competitors don't have easy access) - It's the law of self preservation and self-perpetuation. In every industry I have worked I never saw a business celebrating because they have more competitors but the contrary, they wish, lobby and vote for politicians who creates more bureaucracy that make it harder for new competitors enter in the market, therefore keeping it profitable for those who are in.

Politicians are usually people from the upper classes and often have big business financing or donating to their electoral campaign. But they do it expecting the candidate to return the help with politics that these companies and wealthy have more interests.

Additionally, to avoid unnecessary printing costs, central bank issues new banknotes.

For simplicity, imagine that the only thing Zimbabweans need is bread, and there’s a certain amount of bread in Zimbabwe. There’s also a lot of notes with numbers printed on them, and we accept that these notes can be exchanged for bread. If we add up all the numbers on the notes, and divide by the number of loaves of bread, we know how many notes we need to get a single loaf of bread.

Now suppose I print a whole lot more notes. Can I afford more bread? Two things to think about. First, the total quantity of notes has gone up, so the average price of bread must have risen (assuming everyone knows how many notes and how many loaves there are). Second, I (the person who printed the notes) now have a larger share of the total notes. So I can afford more bread, but it’s come at the expense of everyone else being able to afford less.

This is more or less what the Zimbabwean government did. Of course, very few people know exactly how many notes and how many loaves exist in our toy economy, but they sure do notice that notes are becoming more plentiful, but bread is not. So the price does indeed rise, and this we call inflation. The reason it’s bad is not because the number on the notes has some special meaning, but because the notes that people had are now worth less (because the government suddenly has a whole lot more notes). There has been a *transfer of wealth* from people who hold money to people who print it.

On the other hand, if the government had one day declared that henceforth Z$1 = Z$10, and updated everyone’s wallets, bank balances, and contracts accordingly, this would have had no effect at all.

So I hope this makes clear that it’s the mechanism of inflation that matters, not the inflation per se."

1027,AutoModerator,removecomment,2019-07-13 05:51:31,t1_etnr8ue,"Interesting question. Theoretically, assuming perfect competition, the minimum wage would stabilize at some equilibrium point where the supply of labor meets the demand for labor (standard Econ theory). Realistically and logically, the jobs that would take the greatest hit would be low-skilled jobs. I envision two different scenarios.

Scenario 1: In this market, labor supply for unskilled labor would be enormous and so firms would be able to get by, by offering lower and lower wages and firing employees who refused to work at those lower wages. That wage would probably be pushed down significantly below what minimum wage currently stands at. Meanwhile, higher paying jobs would be hardly affected, and therefore income inequality would grow. (I’m holding all else equal: housing prices, inflation, etc as a result of abolished minimum wage). 

Scenario 2: Because minimum wage as is, is already incredibly low and unsustainable for families, unskilled workers (especially those who had families) would be unwilling to work at wages lower than minimum wage. So I predict families would start emigrating out of America, the unskilled-single labor market would potentially rise, and the demand for education (in pursuit of higher wages) would rise significantly. This might accompany simultaneously (or maybe alternatively) a shortage in labor supply, forcing companies that hire low-skilled workers to pay a wage that would likely be close to the actual minimum wage."

Additionally, importing certain foods or ingredients might be affected by tariffs, the value of currency purchasing the food in general might fluctuate due to literally millions of reasons, they might just sell a burger for less of a profit because the people in that area just can not afford more, which then goes back to quality of ingredients

1029,Randy_Newman1502,approvecomment,2019-07-13 02:07:51,t1_etlk9be,"You are asking a question that Economists don't want to touch with a 10-meter pole for several reasons. You're asking us to compare ideologies that are

* ill-defined and too vague for a serious discussion
* never existed in pure form so no evidence could be gathered
* often motivated by normative reasons that lie outside the scope of economics
* secular beliefs at best, and certainly not scientific.

But I respect your desire to figure out what generally works well. So let me rephrase your question in a way that, I think, makes it answerable to economists:

I define an economic system as society’s way of coordinating the production and consumption of goods and services. It's most basic task is to answer what, how, and for whom it produces. Your question is then an empirical one: Which characteristics of an economic system are most important to reliably achieve high economic growth and per-capita income? I deliberately left out ""fairness"" or income equality because that is too ill-defined and will only lead to lenghty discussions about whether it is a goal or a characteristics of an economic system and how it should be traded off with the other goals (e.g. everyone having nothing and starving to death is one of the most equal outcome). Furthermore, countries that can sustain both high growth and income for a long time usually do also best in terms of inequality, unless they are extremely corrupt.

I think the most important insight of Economics in that regard is that incentives matter. The most effective system is one that aligns the incentives of self-interested individuals with society's goals. Now since you state that we're social animals, you might object that self-interest does not or should not matter. Economists generally disagree sharply with the ""does not""-part (unless you limit the scope of ecomonic activity to family-like circles) and will not discuss the ""should not""-part, because that is not a question of real world Economics (that is why they assert the first part). If you want to take Economics seriously, you will have to accept that self-interested incentives matter.

The characteristics of economic systems that are most crucial to align society's goals of long-lasting wealth with incentives of self-interested individuals are private property rights and a lack of corruption. These factors also pop up if you [empirically analyze why some countries are rich and others poor. Why do some countries experience sustained levels of high growth while others stagnate?](https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/EmpiricsofEconomicGrowth.html)

In contrast, socialist/communist economic systems have done the worst job both at aligning self-interested incentives with society's goals, as well at sustaining high growth and prosperity, both at an overall and individual level. That is why socialism is dead in academic economics, besides the fact that it is ill-defined. But I realize that you would like to have a better explanation of why it failed that conclusively.

If you want to make another toothpick, you don't have to buy the knife again, so you only need more wood. So the price to make two toothpicks is 5+1+1 or 7$, or 3.5$ per toothpick. That should be pretty self evident. It's just Output=fixed input+variable input.

Anyway, although that's certainly testable, it's a bit too simple for empirical work. I mean, you can test it yourself. You have nothing but an empty apartment, what's your cost to make one toast? You need at least a toaster, a plate, a knife, and something to put on the toast. What's your cost to make twenty? You have to buy new toast, but the rest probably lasts for twenty toast, and you certainly don't have to buy another toaster. That's your economy of scale right there.

And you need a knife, let's say that costs five dollars. So the cost to make one toothpick is 6$, right? If you want to make another toothpick, you don't have to buy the knife again, so you only need more wood. So the price to make two toothpicks is 5+1+1 or 7$, or 3.5$ per toothpick. That should be pretty self evident. It's just Output=fixed input+variable input.

Anyway, although that's certainly testable, it's a bit too simple for empirical work. I mean, you can test it yourself. You have nothing but an empty apartment, what's your cost to make one toast? You need at least a toaster, a plate, a knife, and something to put on the toast. What's your cost to make twenty? You have to buy new toast, but the rest probably lasts for twenty toast, and you certainly don't have to buy another toaster. That's your economy of scale right there.

You run into the problem of how you can maintain a collusive agreement. A result from game theory says in equilibrium we expect all agents to be acting optimally given the others players strategy. Suppose there are 10 apartment complexes, the collusive agreement might be something like the 10 firms acting like a monopoly and splitting the monopoly profits among them. The issue is there is an incentive to deviate, charge rent slightly lower and get much more business. So to say they can just meet and set a price is a bit naive, as there needs to be ways to properly enforce the cooperative, monopoly rent."

Always be sure to check out the FAQ on the [minimum wage](https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/wiki/faq_minwage). Since your question is sort of basic and simple I will answer along a similar line.

>If so, what exactly keeps their wages from falling to the minimum wage?

The minimum wage is not relevant for all jobs. Highly valuable jobs which require a lot of talent only have a limited pool thus require competition from firms. Imagine, for example, that a high quality copyright lawyer could save a big company 1 million USD a year, and only a few of these lawyers are to be found. Obviously, if company A only offers minimum wage, company B will offer more. In this way we reach an equilibrium.

> If not, then why is the law needed at all?

Because not every job is the same. Perhaps there are many people available to do certain odd-jobs, and society thinks that these people should earn a certain set amount at a minimum for a job done (for example, enough to live on one job). Basically, we could argue that the equilibrium we reach is too low, or unfair. For these people, a raise in the minimum wage will be a raise in their earnings.

This is really relatively basic textbook stuff. What you seem to miss is that not every job is the same. The minimum wage only targets certain jobs at the lower end of the earnings spectrum.

1092,AutoModerator,removecomment,2019-07-12 13:46:28,t1_etlk9be,"You are asking a question that Economists don't want to touch with a 10-meter pole for several reasons. You're asking us to compare ideologies that are

* ill-defined and too vague for a serious discussion
* never existed in pure form so no evidence could be gathered
* often motivated by normative reasons that lie outside the scope of economics
* secular beliefs at best, and certainly not scientific.

But I respect your desire to figure out what generally works well. So let me rephrase your question in a way that, I think, makes it answerable to economists:

I define an economic system as society’s way of coordinating the production and consumption of goods and services. It's most basic task is to answer what, how, and for whom it produces. Your question is then an empirical one: Which characteristics of an economic system are most important to reliably achieve high economic growth and per-capita income? I deliberately left out ""fairness"" or income equality because that is too ill-defined and will only lead to lenghty discussions about whether it is a goal or a characteristics of an economic system and how it should be traded off with the other goals (e.g. everyone having nothing and starving to death is one of the most equal outcome). Furthermore, countries that can sustain both high growth and income for a long time usually do also best in terms of inequality, unless they are extremely corrupt.

I think the most important insight of Economics in that regard is that incentives matter. The most effective system is one that aligns the incentives of self-interested individuals with society's goals. Now since you state that we're social animals, you might object that self-interest does not or should not matter. Economists generally disagree sharply with the ""does not""-part (unless you limit the scope of ecomonic activity to family-like circles) and will not discuss the ""should not""-part, because that is not a question of real world Economics (that is why they assert the first part). If you want to take Economics seriously, you will have to accept that self-interested incentives matter.

The characteristics of economic systems that are most crucial to align society's goals of long-lasting wealth with incentives of self-interested individuals are private property rights and a lack of corruption. These factors also pop up if you [empirically analyze why some countries are rich and others poor. Why do some countries experience sustained levels of high growth while others stagnate?](https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/EmpiricsofEconomicGrowth.html)

In contrast, socialist/communist economic systems have done the worst job both at aligning self-interested incentives with society's goals, as well at sustaining high growth and prosperity, both at an overall and individual level. That is why socialism is dead in academic economics, besides the fact that it is ill-defined. But I realize that you would like to have a better explanation of why it failed that conclusively. [Here is the best, good-faith argument on why it failed that I could find.](https://medium.com/@hugonewman/the-best-good-faith-arguments-against-socialism-draft-296c33c143d8)"

It's better to look at the finding of specific studies. The [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/wiki/faq_minwage) has a few of the major ones linked and a [fresh new study](https://irle.berkeley.edu/minimum-wage-effects-in-low-wage-areas/) was just published about a week ago. In general, I'd say the findings are that a minimum wage hike wouldn't adversely affect employment levels. If we raise it all at once, it would probably be a different story, but no one is suggesting that so it's nothing but a straw man. 

Anyone that says that the USA is saliently different than any other first world economy is a person that wants to believe what they want to believe and will go on believing it in the face of whatever facts are presented. 

I think it was the Card and Kruger study that found that a 40% increase in minimum wage corresponded with a 4% increase in prices. To my knowledge not a single study has been published that shows that a minimum wage would increase prices dramatically. This is intuitive also since labor is only a part of the costs that go into your food. It's just impossible for a 50% increase in labor cost to increase the cost of the product by 50%. The common concern that comes up is an increase in unemployment, not price increases. 

I'm sorry your ""friends"" are like that. It's a bit absurd to be making fun of someone for a belief on a topic where they clearly do not know much about the field at all. I think they need a reminder of this -- that they are only regurgitating other peoples' ideas. Ideas that they have cherry picked according to their own value systems. My advice would be to read the studies, or at least the findings in the studies and use that as your ammunition. If they try to pull out some basic introductory economics crap, remind them according to economic theory, there is no consensus because it's just too hard to tell. 

Don't forget, it's also perfectly reasonable to believe that humans deserve a certain wage, regardless of the effect on the economy. The law is meant to be imbued with our values. It's not just there to protect property rights."

Econ tests are kind of tricks, especially once you're past the first couple years. Virtually every 3rd and 4th year econ class I took they would do the same annoying thing, where they would teach you a bunch of theory, then the exam would be only 4 super specific math problems that you never actually went over in class or was in the book. So, be prepared for tests that aren't that difficult, but are insanely hard to prepare yourself for, which means that you're virtually always under-prepared. 

You should decide soon into the semester whether your professor is a good one or not, and if he's not, be sure to study outside of class every day, because his class will be useless but you still need to pass. 

&#x200B;

As for econ being a mix of history and math, that's sort of true. Frankly, for undergrad economics, you only need to know how to take derivatives. The rest of the math is simple algebra involving specific equations. It's mostly interpreting equations and knowing how to implement them. This isn't mentioning econometrics, which is just using statistics to find relationships in data. Definitely take all the econometrics courses you can. You might find them the most boring, but they're the most sought after skill an econ undergrad can have. A good bet for you would be to get a math minor and an econ major. 

Also, the hardest part of college isn't the material, it's getting yourself to sit down everyday and study. I wish colleges only made you enroll in one class at a time and take it for 3 weeks, because juggling 5 classes is the hardest part of college. What worked for me in the end was treating it like a job. First class is at 9am? Great, don't quit working until 5pm, even if it's monday and your next hw assignment isn't due til thursday.

This is actually an interesting question. It makes sense that a large deposit could be as good as if not better than pay stubs, as a signal of ability to make rent. And I'm sure that in some cases it is actually done, e.g. when someone is temporarily out of work but has a lot of cash. 

But think about how large the deposit would need to be to really cover the liability of several months of rent, especially considering how long it takes to evict a tenant.

> Also, why isn't there more of a market for cheap rental apartments?

This is a much more complicated question. The basic answer is that, in general, people have a high willingness to pay for new construction. So if you're building a new building, people are already willing to pay a premium. And the buyers who are buying new construction--and willing to pay a premium for it--will also pay for more space, better finishes, nicer amenities, etc. So new construction tends to target that segment.

It's kind of how people don't build huge houses with bare bones finishes; rather, size and quality are complements. And the age of a home is an attribute that people are willing to pay for.

In general, most cheaper housing isn't built as such but rather begins as more expensive housing that becomes cheaper over time through depreciation. This is called ""filtering"" in real estate, as new, premium housing filters through over time into the lower-end of the market. 

Finally, there are regulatory barriers. Sometimes zoning laws mandate minimum sizes of units. And there are fixed costs of construction--regardless of quality--that drive up the price as well, so it naturally makes sense to target it toward a more premium market."

To summarize, depending on the state, landlords are only allowed to require (and presumably accept?) 1-2 months worth of rent payment as a security deposit for things like damages.  I don't know if they're even allowed to accept a ""general deposit"" to cover things like rent.

What you could do is pre-pay your rent for a large portion of the lease agreement.  I've done this before when I was going to be out of town for several months and just wrote one big check at the beginning, gave it to the landlord, and said, ""see you in the fall!""  But this might be more hassle than it's worth for the landlord, who might have to keep track of multiple tenants and keep some sort of organized spreadsheet about who's paying what amount and how long until their next payment is due, which is of course a cost."

You can think of the low-skilled workers competing a la Bertrand, with other workers being perfect or almost perfect substitutes.  Even if there are many employers for a low-skilled job, the low-skilled workers are essentially price takers -- if a low-skilled worker holds out for $16 an hour instead of $15, the employer can easily replace this worker with someone who accepts the $15.

For microchip designers, skilled programmers, surgeons, etc -- these professions have more ability to command a high wage, in part because it's hard to find another person to do the job.  If there are three large hospitals in Cleveland, and the smallest of the three is trying to hire a spine neurosurgeon who is willing to take the job, will do it well, works well with the team, etc -- it's not trivial to find another such person who is equally good.

One possible explanation from classical theory is that the producer still has to cover costs if demand decreases and so raises price.  This only really works though if the producer has pricing power like in a monopoly.  It would also tend to require fairly inelastic demand for output to stay the same at the increased price, a lack of suitable substitutes etc.

What you're discussing might come more from behavioral economics and the concept of [perceived value](https://www.celent.com/insights/430083255).

The basic thinking is that although classical microeconomics understands marginal utility theory, baskets etc. extremely well.  However, almost no one sits in the grocery doing calculus and plotting curves, so under behavioral theory instead we use short heuristics like, ""This $20 olive oil must be better than the $10 oil because it costs more and I want this meal to be special so I'll get the good stuff""  to aid our decision making."

These are, calculus up to multivariate (if you are American up to calc 3), linear algebra and real analysis. The good news is the some of these courses will likely be required for majoring in stats and Econ. The only one that isn't is real analysis but that is useful for the theoretical basis of statistics (probability theory) so you may be able to fit it in as part of a stats major.

As for the effects on admissions of majoring in stats vs maths, I don't know how large an impact it will have but if you get good grades your ability to get into the top PhD programs will likely depend more on the letters of recommendation from professors rather than the specific major.

Finally a word of warning, you are not going to be able to avoid calculus/algebra if you take advanced Econ classes/especially grad classes. so if you are worried about being rusty you should consider either brushing up at some point using Khan academy or taking some maths courses at college."

One possible explanation from classical theory is that the producer still has to cover costs if demand decreases and so raises price.  This only really works though if the producer has pricing power like in a monopoly.  It would also tend to require fairly inelastic demand for output to stay the same at the increased price, a lack of suitable substitutes etc.

What you're discussing might come more from behavioral economics and the concept of [perceived value](https://www.celent.com/insights/430083255).  One example is that a higher price alone might make a product *seem* like it's better even if there's no reason from a cost or value standpoint to be priced so.  The basic thinking is that although classical microeconomics understands marginal utility theory, baskets etc. extremely well.  However, almost no one sits in the grocery doing calculus and plotting curves, so under behavioral theory instead we use short heuristics like, ""This $20 olive oil must be better than the $10 oil because it costs more and I want this meal to be special so I'll get the good stuff""  to aid our decision making."

Low-skilled workers have basically no market power, because the employer can easily find new people to fill the same job.  You can think of the low-skilled workers competing a la Bertrand, with other workers being perfect or almost perfect substitutes.  Even if there are many employers for a low-skilled job, the low-skilled workers are essentially price takers -- if a low-skilled worker holds out for $16 an hour instead of $15, the employer can easily replace this worker with someone who accepts the $15.

For microchip designers, skilled programmers, surgeons, etc -- these professions have more ability to command a high wage, in part because it's hard to find another person to do the job.  If there are three large hospitals in Cleveland, and the smallest of the three is trying to hire a spine neurosurgeon who is willing to take the job, will do it well, works well with the team, etc -- it's not trivial to find another such person who is equally good.

1232,AutoModerator,removecomment,2019-07-10 18:40:43,t1_etg578y,"I think the two are intertwined. Computer chips and other electronics going down in price is largely a result of engineers gaining experience in the manufacture in electronic components combined with economies of scale as production quantities increase. You see similar things happen in other industries like textiles and farming, as engineers continually innovate newer, quicker, cheaper machines. If everyone in a market is continually upgrading, than the market leans towards price rather than qualitative competition - leading to commoditization and lower prices for consumers.

On the flip side, cheaper electronic chips and computing power has made made workers more productive. Another way of thinking about this is the opportunity cost of an hour of labor relative to other goods that can be produced. If cheaper computing power and automation has led to a single manufacturing employee to increase the value of their time from 10 chips an hour to 30 chips an hour, the ratio of manufacturing goods to service goods that can be produced in a single employee hour goes up - so in essence the cost of things like teachers, doctors, lawyers, scientists goes up in terms of computer chips. Because the input chain of drugs are the result of education, scientific research, doctors and lawyers all coming together to put a product on the market - all of these jobs have been relatively resistant to automation, the cost of labor for drugs has gone up significantly relative to computer chips.

Another important factor might be winner-take-all effects in both markets. Computer chips, in a relatively competitive market that competes on price have been incentivized to cut costs in order to avoid being outcompeted by others. Drug companies, who exist in a market in which only the newest, best drug is prescribed - are incentivized to put out the best possible product they can - regardless of price."

 [https://wid.world/document/bcg2019-full-paper/](https://wid.world/document/bcg2019-full-paper/) 

American race gap:

 [https://www.sociologicalscience.com/download/vol-5/march/SocSci\_v5\_182to205.pdf](https://www.sociologicalscience.com/download/vol-5/march/SocSci_v5_182to205.pdf) 

But its a very complex issue on both ends and depends on how you define ""wealth gap."" The breakdown of income class by race is here:

 [https://www.brookings.edu/blog/social-mobility-memos/2018/02/27/the-middle-class-is-becoming-race-plural-just-like-the-rest-of-america/](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/social-mobility-memos/2018/02/27/the-middle-class-is-becoming-race-plural-just-like-the-rest-of-america/) 

But if you take away race and plot just distribution of wealth you can see that the top 1% in America owns the same amount of wealth as the next 9% below them, while the rest of the 90% is dropping significantly in wealth owned.

 [https://equitablegrowth.org/the-distribution-of-wealth-in-the-united-states-and-implications-for-a-net-worth-tax/](https://equitablegrowth.org/the-distribution-of-wealth-in-the-united-states-and-implications-for-a-net-worth-tax/) 

Fortunately, the gap is slowly narrowing and median African American income is rising the most out of any other racial group in American. Unfortunately it still exists and discrimination is alive and well in employment practices as evidenced by similarly educated African Americans not performing as well as their white counterparts.

IMO Eastern European wealth inequality has a lot to do with governmental incompetence as you can see by the opinions of the people:

 [https://www.pewforum.org/2017/05/10/views-on-economic-issues/](https://www.pewforum.org/2017/05/10/views-on-economic-issues/) 

 Communism ruined Eastern Europe and completely destabilized all former Soviet Blocs which allowed for some pretty extreme political groups to come in and take complete advantage of these countries

 [https://www.globalresearch.ca/the-tragic-failure-of-post-communism-in-eastern-europe/23616](https://www.globalresearch.ca/the-tragic-failure-of-post-communism-in-eastern-europe/23616) 

So yes, I would say based on most data the divide is much greater between Western/Eastern Europe than African Americans/Whites in the USA. But the gap between the 1% vs the bottom 99% is much worse than that of either."
1248,AutoModerator,removecomment,2019-07-10 11:24:31,t1_etf2lta,"Short answer: lack of competition due to patents in the drug industry. Drug patents in particular get special treatment where holders can extend their patents OR file new patents with every improvement and change.

The microchip was patented in the US in 1964 with a 17 year expiration. The tech companies that make today's processors and computer chip use the microchip foundation but don't infringe on each other's technology by differentiation. An Intel chip doesn't work the same as an AMD chip. The microchip was a one and done patent whereas somthing like Insulin has a complex and complicated past. 

The original patent already expired but with the combination of new patents on methods for synthesizing and delivering insulin AND regulations (which lead to 1. expensive clinical testing and 2. prevents new entrants into the market), Insulin doesn't have a competitive market. The established big player(s) can redesign all aspects of Insulin and file patents for every change. And with that, they unilaterally decide to discontinue their older versions to basically restrict buyer choice. It's all about availability of substitutes. Also looking at the 2 industries, which is going to be heavily regulated and arguably rightfully so?

This is another way to think about it. Take the 2 categories, Computer products and Drugs.

Different computer products can substitute for each other. You need a calculator? You could get a calculator, a laptop, a desktop, or a phone. In contrast, if you need a solution to manage Diabetes, there is only 1 solution and no substitutes."

E-currencies caused great demand for powerful processors used for ""mining"" (basically generating passive cash). I suspect the demand has declined as it is no longer a trendy topic, which causes a period with adjusting, with too high of a supply compared to the quickly declining demand. This causes deflation. 
Meanwhile, drugs are hard to produce, (both legal and illegal), and either the supply has gone down, or the demand has gone up. Somewhere in the supplychain there might be issues currently, I can not know that."

Computer chip prices fall as more innovation occurs so old tech becomes outdated, demand falls thus price falls as firms struggle to sell.

Drugs are always needed (i.e in demand) because in most cases diseases etc. wont be completely erradicated. Knowing this, if world population is increasing, demand for these drugs will be high/increasing, thus the prices rise to ration demand and bring market back to equilibrium.

You can relate to costs with the same S/D concept.

1) It is associated with the belief that the government ""doesn't need to worry"" about balanced budgets, or that large, permanent deficit spending should be encouraged.  I have yet to understand their arguments for it.

2)  I have not found it easy to figure out the core theory and methods of MMT, or how different they are from the stuff you find in MWG, Stokey-Lucas, or the most cited papers.  Is it just mainstream economics, but they think the costs of deficit spending are usually overstated?  Do they disagree on something more fundamental (say, the reasonableness of using microfounded models of the macroeconomy; or do they insist that economic analysis should mostly be based on accounting identities)?  Do they use mainstream methods, and distinguish themselves only by a particular policy preference?  (In that case, are they really ""heterodox""?)  Do they use different methods?  Any methods?

3)  Despite not knowing the answer to 2, I know that many people talk about MMT, and also that it is widely considered ""heterodox"" / outside the mainstream."

 [https://wid.world/document/bcg2019-full-paper/](https://wid.world/document/bcg2019-full-paper/) 

American race gap:

 [https://www.sociologicalscience.com/download/vol-5/march/SocSci\_v5\_182to205.pdf](https://www.sociologicalscience.com/download/vol-5/march/SocSci_v5_182to205.pdf) 

But its a very complex issue on both ends and depends on how you define ""wealth gap."" The breakdown of income class by race is here:

 [https://www.brookings.edu/blog/social-mobility-memos/2018/02/27/the-middle-class-is-becoming-race-plural-just-like-the-rest-of-america/](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/social-mobility-memos/2018/02/27/the-middle-class-is-becoming-race-plural-just-like-the-rest-of-america/) 

But if you take away race and plot just distribution of wealth you can see that the top 1% in America owns the same amount of wealth as the next 9% below them, while the rest of the 90% is dropping significantly in wealth owned.

 [https://equitablegrowth.org/the-distribution-of-wealth-in-the-united-states-and-implications-for-a-net-worth-tax/](https://equitablegrowth.org/the-distribution-of-wealth-in-the-united-states-and-implications-for-a-net-worth-tax/) 

Fortunately, the gap is slowly narrowing and median African American income is rising the most out of any other racial group in American. Unfortunately it still exists and discrimination is alive and well in employment practices as evidenced by similarly educated African Americans not performing as well as their white counterparts.

IMO Eastern European wealth inequality has a lot to do with governmental incompetence as you can see by the opinions of the people:

 [https://www.pewforum.org/2017/05/10/views-on-economic-issues/](https://www.pewforum.org/2017/05/10/views-on-economic-issues/) 

 Communism ruined Eastern Europe and completely destabilized all former Soviet Blocs which allowed for some pretty extreme political groups to come in and take complete advantage of these countries

 [https://www.globalresearch.ca/the-tragic-failure-of-post-communism-in-eastern-europe/23616](https://www.globalresearch.ca/the-tragic-failure-of-post-communism-in-eastern-europe/23616) 

So yes, I would say based on most data the divide is much greater between Western/Eastern Europe than African Americans/Whites in the USA. But the gap between the 1% vs the bottom 99% is much worse than that of either."

Instead of having cash in your pocket, you could also put it on your banking account, which would earn you interest rates. So there's an opportunity cost for holding cash. When interest rates rise (and income remains the same), this will raise the opportunity costs.

A bit more formally, demand for money can be expressed as L = kY - hi, where Y is the income, k the consumption factor, i is the interest rate and h accounts for shoe leather costs. So clearly, when interest i goes up, then L goes up, all other things being equal."

Elasticity is [d(ln Y)] / [d (ln X)], where increasing ln X by 1 is equivalent to multiplying x by e (or another constant, if you choose to use another base).   It's equivalent to [dY/dX] * [X/Y], where the units cancel.

There's obviously the question of, ""from which of the canonical four components of GDP (consumer spending, investment, government spending, and net exports) did this rise originate?"" But that's probably not what you're after by asking this question, since that's almost a tautology. Questions they ask in basic econ like ""if investment increases, what does GDP do?"" are basically like asking, ""if aggregate demand increases, what happens to aggregate demand?"". (GDP and aggregate demand are essentially the same thing.) It's incredibly elementary and has no deeper explanatory power.

More interesting to examine would be what *permitted or triggered* the rise in spending to begin with. Was it that people started digging into their savings a bit more? Was it that more resources were found which permitted increased production of goods and services? Was it that the government increased the money supply in the economy and created temporary stimulation which lasted long enough (before the euphoria died off and inflation set in) to render an increase in real spending in the latest GDP figure?

Could be any number of these things."

1. Are we talking about mean wealth or median wealth, when we talk about wealth gap? There is a huge difference, particularly in the USA, because of the greater social inequality than in Europe. Median wealth is a better indicator of what the average person owns than mean wealth is, obviously.

2. It really depends on what you mean by Eastern Europe. If you mean former socialist republics, you'd have to include the Czech republic, but Czechs usually do not consider themselves Eastern Europeans, and usually take offence at that. If you mean geographically, you'd probably have to include Greece in Eastern Europe, even though it was the only capitalist country in the region.

3. The wealth gap is less important in Europe than it is in the US, because of more reliable social safety nets. A pensioner can get by with zero net wealth in many European countries much better than in the USA. So while you can make the comparison, the comparison will not be very meaningful.

4. Also, PPP. What you can actually do with the same wealth is quite different if you live in London vs. in Kiev, and this difference is much greater than if you take black-majority neighbourhoods vs white-majority neighbourhoods in the US.

All of this being said, taking **mean** wealth, and not doing PPP:

* According to [this link](https://voxeu.org/article/decline-african-american-and-hispanic-wealth-great-recession), the ratio of the mean net worth of blacks to whites in the US is 0.14.

* According to [Credit Suisse](https://www.credit-suisse.com/corporate/en/research/research-institute/global-wealth-report/tables.html), we have, for some of the most populous countries in Europe:
