The fed had to do QE and Ben Bernake a scholar  of the last depression, knew what had to be done to avoid an even worse recession. Unlike Trump , Obama had competent people running the various departments of the government, and their best professional opinion was for government spending to shore up the economy.

Contrast that with Trump who wasn't  facing any impending economic issues, and supposedly had a mandate from the Republicans to control the deficit. Somehow the Republicans excused him of such constraints, because he was aligned with them on ""cultural issues"" ( immigration, abortion, Christian rights, etc) , and he pushed through a very business friendly package that increased the debt.

Most of the business benefits/gains  going to stockholders (buybacks, dividend etc) or owners not the general economy, so the debt ballooned as predicted by OMB , with little real economic  benefit that might have reduced the debt."
